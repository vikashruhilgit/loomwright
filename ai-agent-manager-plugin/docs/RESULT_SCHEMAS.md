# Result Schemas

> Strict contracts for all agent result blocks. Hooks validate against these schemas.
> All schemas include `schema_version: 1` for forward compatibility.

## WORKER_RESULT

Produced by Worker agent on task completion.

```yaml
WORKER_RESULT:
  schema_version: 1                    # integer, required — always 1
  task_id: string                      # required — subtask identifier (e.g., "BD-15a" or "add-auth-guard")
  status: enum [completed, failed, partial]  # required
  files_modified: string[]             # required — non-empty when status=completed
  files_created: string[]              # optional — new files created
  tests_added: string[]               # optional — test files added or modified
  tests_passed: boolean               # optional — true if all tests pass
  summary: string                      # required — max 200 tokens, what was done
  error: string                        # conditional — required when status=failed, describes what went wrong
```

**Validation rules:**
- `schema_version` must equal `1`
- `task_id` must be non-empty string

- When `status=completed`: `files_modified` must be non-empty array
- When `status=failed`: `error` must be present and non-empty
- `summary` must be present and under 200 tokens

**Example:**
```
WORKER_RESULT:
  schema_version: 1
  task_id: add-jwt-guard
  status: completed
  files_modified: [src/auth/jwt.guard.ts, src/auth/jwt.strategy.ts]
  files_created: [src/auth/jwt.guard.spec.ts]

### QA_RESULT Session Extensions

When QA Executor runs with `--plan`, `--scope`, or `--continue`, the QA_RESULT includes additional fields:

```yaml
# Additional fields in QA_RESULT for session mode:
  depth: enum [smoke, functional]      # required — test depth used
  scope: string                        # optional — scope name (null for --plan)
  session_id: string                   # optional — unique session identifier
  cumulative_coverage: object          # optional — from coverage.json
    routes_tested: integer
    routes_total: integer
    apis_tested: integer
    apis_total: integer
    scopes_completed: integer
    scopes_total: integer
```

---

## Schema Versioning

All result schemas include a `schema_version` field. This enables forward compatibility:

1. Hooks check `schema_version` before validating fields
2. If `schema_version` is unrecognized, hook warns but does not block
3. New fields can be added without breaking existing validation
4. Breaking changes require incrementing `schema_version`

### Version History

- **CODE_REVIEW_RESULT v2** (v7.0.0): Added `category` field to issues (`new`, `pre_existing`, `nit`). FAIL decisions now require at least one `new` HIGH/BLOCKING issue. Pre-existing issues are reported but do not block.
- **MISSING_FUNCTIONALITY_REPORT v1** (v7.1.0): New schema for QA Executor gap detection output.
- All other schemas remain at v1.

---

## MISSING_FUNCTIONALITY_REPORT

Produced by QA Executor during Phase 4.5 gap analysis. Separate from QA_RESULT.

```yaml
MISSING_FUNCTIONALITY_REPORT:
  schema_version: 1                    # integer, required — always 1
  task_id: string                      # required — QA run identifier
  gaps: object[]                       # required — non-empty array of detected gaps
    - category: enum [missing_crud, missing_pagination, missing_search,
                      missing_validation, missing_error_handling, missing_confirmation,
                      missing_loading_state, missing_rate_limiting,
                      data_integrity_risk, security_boundary_gap, best_practice_gap]
      severity: enum [CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW]
      location: string                 # route/endpoint/component where gap found
      description: string              # what's missing and why it matters
      evidence: string                 # what discovery data led to this conclusion
      recommendation: string           # what should be built/fixed
  summary: string                      # required — concise summary of all gaps
  total_gaps: integer                  # required — total gap count
  critical_count: integer              # required — CRITICAL gaps count
```

**Validation rules:**
- `gaps` must be non-empty (if no gaps found, don't emit the report)
- Each gap must have `category`, `severity`, `location`, `description`
- `total_gaps` must equal `gaps.length`
- `critical_count` must equal count of gaps with `severity=CRITICAL`
- `summary` must be present

**Example:**
```
MISSING_FUNCTIONALITY_REPORT:
  schema_version: 1
  task_id: qa-run-2026-03-22
  gaps:
    - category: missing_crud
      severity: HIGH
      location: POST /api/tournaments
      description: Tournament entity has create endpoint but no edit (PUT) or delete (DELETE)
      evidence: Discovery found POST /api/tournaments but no PUT or DELETE for same resource
      recommendation: Add PUT /api/tournaments/:id and DELETE /api/tournaments/:id endpoints
    - category: missing_rate_limiting
      severity: HIGH
      location: POST /api/auth/login
      description: Login endpoint has no rate limiting — brute force attack vector
      evidence: 5 rapid requests all returned 200 with no 429 response
      recommendation: Add rate limiting (max 5 attempts per minute per IP)
    - category: missing_pagination
      severity: MEDIUM
      location: GET /api/tournaments
      description: List endpoint returns all items with no pagination support
      evidence: No limit/offset/page query parameters detected in API calls
      recommendation: Add pagination with limit/offset or cursor-based approach
  summary: 3 gaps found (2 HIGH, 1 MEDIUM). Missing CRUD operations and rate limiting are highest priority.
  total_gaps: 3
  critical_count: 0
```

## Validation Location

Schema validation occurs in the **hook execution layer**:
- Per-agent `SubagentStop` hooks (in agent frontmatter) validate Worker and Execute Manager results
- Cross-cutting `SubagentStop` hooks (in `hooks.json`) validate Code Reviewer and QA Executor results
- Validation is never duplicated in Supervisor or plugin runtime
