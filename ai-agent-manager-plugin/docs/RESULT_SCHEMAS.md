# Result Schemas

> Strict contracts for all agent result blocks. Hooks validate against these schemas.
> All schemas include a `schema_version` field for forward compatibility. Current versions: CODE_REVIEW_RESULT at `schema_version: 3` (review modes + consistency audit; v2 accepted for legacy); WORKER_RESULT at `schema_version: 2` (outputs_verified contract; v1 accepted for the v12.0.0 transition window); all others at `schema_version: 1`.

> **API-level enforcement:** When using the Claude API directly (outside Claude Code), enforce these schemas via `output_config.format` (JSON Schema mode) for guaranteed conformance — the model is constrained to produce schema-valid output before the response is returned. Plugin hook validation (the `SubagentStop` hooks defined in `hooks.json`) is the runtime fallback validator inside Claude Code, where `output_config` is not available to plugin agents. See `AGENT_GUIDELINES.md` §"Structured Outputs" and the Anthropic API reference for the exact field name in your SDK version.

## WORKER_RESULT

Produced by Worker agent on task completion.

```yaml
WORKER_RESULT:
  schema_version: 2                    # integer, required — v2 adds outputs_verified + outputs_gap (v1 still accepted during the v12.0.0 transition window)
  task_id: string                      # required — subtask identifier (e.g., "BD-15a" or "add-auth-guard")
  status: enum [completed, failed, partial]  # required
  files_modified: string[]             # required — non-empty when status=completed
  files_created: string[]              # optional — new files created
  tests_added: string[]                # optional — test files added or modified
  tests_passed: boolean                # optional — true if all tests pass
  outputs_verified: object[]           # required (v2) — itemized verification of every output the brief promised
    - kind: enum [file, symbol, type]  # required — what was checked
      path: string                     # required — repo-relative path the check was performed against
      name: string                     # optional — symbol/type name (required when kind in {symbol, type})
      status: enum [present, missing]  # required — outcome of the check
  outputs_gap: string                  # required (v2) — empty string when nothing missing; non-empty implies status MUST be partial
  summary: string                      # required — max 200 tokens, what was done
  error: string                        # conditional — required when status=failed, describes what went wrong
```

**Validation rules (schema_version: 2):**
- `schema_version` must equal `2`
- `task_id` must be non-empty string
- `status` must be one of: `completed`, `failed`, `partial`
- When `status=completed`: `files_modified` must be non-empty array
- When `status=failed`: `error` must be present and non-empty
- `summary` must be present and under 200 tokens
- `outputs_verified` must be present (may be `[]` only when the brief promised no concrete outputs); each entry must have `kind`, `path`, `status`; entries with `kind ∈ {symbol, type}` must include `name`
- `outputs_gap` must be present as a string; an empty string means all promised outputs were delivered
- **Cross-field invariant (hook-enforced):** if `outputs_gap` is non-empty AND `status=completed`, the SubagentStop hook rejects with `outputs_gap non-empty must map to status: partial`. A worker that did not deliver all promised outputs has not completed.
- **Runtime checks performed by the SubagentStop hook (not part of the schema, listed for transparency):** the hook also verifies that a `.worker-summary.md` file was written and that no destructive commands (`rm -rf`, `git push`, `git reset --hard`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`) appear in the run output.

**Validation rules (schema_version: 1, legacy):**
- `schema_version` must equal `1`
- All v2 rules except `outputs_verified` and `outputs_gap` (which are not present in v1)
- v1 emissions remain accepted by the SubagentStop hook for the v12.0.0 transition window. Workers running on v12.0.0+ MUST emit v2.

**Example (v2, happy path):**
```
WORKER_RESULT:
  schema_version: 2
  task_id: add-jwt-guard
  status: completed
  files_modified: [src/auth/jwt.guard.ts, src/auth/jwt.strategy.ts]
  files_created: [src/auth/jwt.guard.spec.ts]
  tests_added: [src/auth/jwt.guard.spec.ts]
  tests_passed: true
  outputs_verified:
    - kind: file
      path: src/auth/jwt.guard.ts
      status: present
    - kind: symbol
      path: src/auth/jwt.guard.ts
      name: JwtGuard
      status: present
    - kind: file
      path: src/auth/jwt.guard.spec.ts
      status: present
  outputs_gap: ""
  summary: Implemented JWT guard with passport strategy. Added unit tests with 92% coverage.
```

**Example (v2, partial — gap reported):**
```
WORKER_RESULT:
  schema_version: 2
  task_id: add-jwt-guard
  status: partial
  files_modified: [src/auth/jwt.guard.ts]
  files_created: []
  outputs_verified:
    - kind: file
      path: src/auth/jwt.guard.ts
      status: present
    - kind: file
      path: src/auth/jwt.guard.spec.ts
      status: missing
  outputs_gap: "src/auth/jwt.guard.spec.ts"
  summary: Guard implemented but unit-test file deferred (Jest config absent in the worktree); status partial because outputs_gap names the missing spec.
```

## EXECUTE_RESULT

Produced by Execute Manager when all subtasks are completed.

```yaml
EXECUTE_RESULT:
  schema_version: 1                    # integer, required — always 1
  subtasks_completed: object[]         # required — non-empty array
    - task_id: string                  # subtask identifier
      status: completed                # always "completed" in this array
      branch: string                   # worktree branch name
      files_modified: string[]         # files changed by this subtask
      review_decision: string          # PASS (must be PASS to be in completed)
  subtasks_failed: object[]            # optional — subtasks that failed after retries
    - task_id: string
      status: failed
      error: string
      retry_count: integer
  merge_order: string[]                # required — ordered list of branches to merge
  worktrees: object[]                  # required — worktree details for cleanup
    - task_id: string
      path: string                     # absolute path to worktree
      branch: string                   # branch name in worktree
      status: enum [completed, failed, cleaned]
  branches: string[]                   # optional — all branches created
  summary: string                      # required — execution summary
```

**Validation rules:**
- `schema_version` must equal `1`
- `subtasks_completed` must be non-empty array (at least one subtask succeeded)
- `merge_order` must be non-empty array matching completed subtask branches
- `worktrees` must be non-empty array with valid paths
- `summary` must be present

**Example:**
```
EXECUTE_RESULT:
  schema_version: 1
  subtasks_completed:
    - task_id: add-jwt-guard
      status: completed
      branch: feature/add-jwt-guard
      files_modified: [src/auth/jwt.guard.ts]
      review_decision: PASS
    - task_id: add-refresh-token
      status: completed
      branch: feature/add-refresh-token
      files_modified: [src/auth/refresh.service.ts]
      review_decision: PASS
  merge_order: [feature/add-jwt-guard, feature/add-refresh-token]
  worktrees:
    - task_id: add-jwt-guard
      path: /Users/name/myapp-add-jwt-guard
      branch: feature/add-jwt-guard
      status: completed
    - task_id: add-refresh-token
      path: /Users/name/myapp-add-refresh-token
      branch: feature/add-refresh-token
      status: completed
  summary: 2/2 subtasks completed. JWT guard and refresh token service implemented.
```

## EXECUTE_CHECKPOINT

Produced by Execute Manager when budget is exceeded or partial progress needs saving.

```yaml
EXECUTE_CHECKPOINT:
  schema_version: 1                    # integer, required — always 1
  completed_so_far: object[]           # required — subtasks already done
    - task_id: string
      status: completed
      branch: string
      files_modified: string[]
  in_progress: object[]                # optional — currently running subtasks
    - task_id: string
      status: in_progress
      worktree_path: string
      agent_id: string                 # Task agent ID for potential resume
  remaining: object[]                  # required — subtasks not yet started
    - task_id: string
      status: pending
      dependencies: string[]           # task_ids that must complete first
  resume_context: object               # required — data needed to resume
    tool_calls_used: integer
    active_worktrees: string[]         # paths that still exist
    feature_branch: string
  reason: string                       # required — why checkpointing (budget, error, etc.)
  adjudication_required: boolean       # optional (v12) — true when the Execute Manager has detected an outputs gap that requires Supervisor/operator decision
  missing_outputs: object[]            # conditional (v12) — required and non-empty when adjudication_required=true
    - item: string                     # what is missing (file path, symbol, contract field)
      producing_subtask: string        # which subtask was supposed to produce it
      check_run: string                # what verification was performed (e.g., "ls", "ts-symbol-search", "schema-grep")
  adjudication_options: string[]       # conditional (v12) — required and non-empty when adjudication_required=true
                                       # typically ["A: re-queue producer", "B: insert remediation subtask",
                                       # "C: exit to Launch Pad", "D: update consumer brief"]
```

**Validation rules:**
- `schema_version` must equal `1`
- `completed_so_far` must be present (can be empty array if no subtasks done yet)
- `remaining` must be present and non-empty (otherwise use EXECUTE_RESULT)
- `resume_context` must be present with at least `feature_branch`
- `reason` must be non-empty string
- **toolset_gap rejection (hook-enforced, v12):** if `reason` cites `toolset_gap`, "Task tool unavailable", "Agent tool unavailable", or any variant claiming the spawning toolset is missing, the SubagentStop hook rejects the checkpoint. The Execute Manager spawns workers via Task and that capability is guaranteed by the harness; the actual blocker must be restated without referencing toolset availability.
- **Adjudication tri-field invariant (hook-enforced, v12):** the three fields `adjudication_required`, `missing_outputs`, and `adjudication_options` appear together (all-or-nothing). When `adjudication_required: true`, both `missing_outputs` and `adjudication_options` MUST be non-empty arrays. The SubagentStop hook (see `hooks.json` Execute Manager entry) rejects checkpoints that set the flag without populating both arrays.

## SUPERVISOR_RESULT

Produced by Supervisor once per task from inside Phase 4.5's completion tail (see Emission cadence below). Introduced in v11.0.0 to give a machine-readable completion record (replaces free-form markdown validation in the SubagentStop hook).

```yaml
SUPERVISOR_RESULT:
  schema_version: 1                    # integer, required — always 1
  task_id: string                      # required — task being worked on
  status: enum [completed, completed_with_escalation, failed, checkpoint]  # required
  pr_url: string | null                # required when status in [completed, completed_with_escalation]; null for failed/checkpoint
  branch: string                       # required — feature branch name
  subtasks_completed: integer          # required — count of subtasks that passed review and merged
  subtasks_failed: integer             # required — count of subtasks that failed after retries
  heal_loop_ran: boolean              # required — did the Phase 4.5 review loop execute?
  heal_iterations: integer | null      # required — number of fix iterations that ran; null when heal_loop_ran=false
  heal_decision: enum [PASS, ESCALATED] | null  # required — null when heal_loop_ran=false (phase transition and completion tail always run; only the review-and-fix loop is gated, so no decision is produced when skipped)
  heal_fixable_issues_fixed: integer   # required — count of new+BLOCKING/HIGH issues auto-fixed across all iterations; 0 when heal_loop_ran=false
  heal_remaining_issues: integer       # required — count of new+BLOCKING/HIGH issues still unresolved in final review; 0 when heal_loop_ran=false or heal_decision=PASS
  error: string | null                 # conditional — required when status=failed
  summary: string                      # required — concise session summary
  cost_profile: enum [default, cheap] | null  # optional — null when flag not passed (equivalent to default)
  rubric_score: string | null          # optional (v12.2.0+) — "N/M" where N is non-negative (>= 0; "0/M" is the legitimate all-fail case), M is positive (>= 1), M >= N; null when no Outcomes Rubric in brief, heal_decision != PASS, or grader parse failed
```

**Field semantics note:** `heal_loop_ran` reports whether the Phase 4.5 *review-and-fix loop* executed, not whether the phase itself transitioned. The phase transition and completion tail are unconditional; only the loop is gated by `--skip-self-heal` and the resume-thrash guard.

**Emission cadence:** Exactly one `SUPERVISOR_RESULT` block is emitted *per task*, from inside Phase 4.5's completion tail (after `status`/`pr_url`/heal fields are finalized). Phase 5 LOOP does NOT emit a block — it only decides whether to loop or exit. When a session processes multiple tasks via LOOP → ACQUIRE, multiple `SUPERVISOR_RESULT` blocks appear in the transcript (one per task). The SubagentStop hook validates the last block in the output; earlier blocks must also be schema-valid but are not hook-checked.

**Validation rules:**
- `schema_version` must equal `1`
- `status` must be one of: `completed`, `completed_with_escalation`, `failed`, `checkpoint`
- When `status in [completed, completed_with_escalation]`: `pr_url` must be present and non-empty
- When `status=failed`: `error` must be present and non-empty
- `heal_loop_ran` must be a boolean
- When `heal_loop_ran=false`: `heal_iterations=null`, `heal_decision=null`, `heal_fixable_issues_fixed=0`, `heal_remaining_issues=0` exactly
- When `heal_loop_ran=true`: `heal_decision` must be one of `[PASS, ESCALATED]` (NOT `SKIPPED` — skipping corresponds to `heal_loop_ran=false`), `heal_iterations` must be a non-negative integer
- `heal_fixable_issues_fixed` and `heal_remaining_issues` must be non-negative integers
- `heal_remaining_issues=0` when `heal_decision=PASS` (PASS means no BLOCKING/HIGH new issues remain)
- `heal_remaining_issues>=1` when `heal_decision=ESCALATED`
- `summary` must be present
- `rubric_score` is optional (additive in v12.2.0, schema version unchanged at 1). When present, it MUST be either `null` or a string matching the format `"N/M"` where N is a non-negative integer (`>= 0` — `"0/M"` is the legitimate all-fail case where the grader ran but every rubric item failed), M is a positive integer (`>= 1` — there is no zero-item rubric), and M ≥ N. The two non-null forms have distinct meaning: `null` = grader did not run (no rubric in brief, `heal_decision != PASS`, or grader parse failure); `"0/M"` = grader ran and scored zero items. When absent, validators MUST treat it as `null`. The Supervisor SubagentStop hook MUST NOT reject a SUPERVISOR_RESULT solely for the presence or absence of `rubric_score`.

**Status mapping from heal outcome:**
- `heal_decision=PASS` OR `heal_loop_ran=false` (loop skipped via `--skip-self-heal`) → `status: completed`
- `heal_decision=ESCALATED` → `status: completed_with_escalation`
- Hard failure (merge conflict, fix task crash after retries) → `status: failed`
- Budget exhaustion → `status: checkpoint`

**Example (happy path, heal passed first try):**
```
SUPERVISOR_RESULT:
  schema_version: 1
  task_id: add-jwt-auth
  status: completed
  pr_url: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42

  notes: string                        # optional — v10.3.0: free-form notes (e.g., "budget_exceeded", "playwright_config_auto_generated")
  error: string                        # conditional — required when status=failed
```

**Validation rules:**
- `schema_version` must equal `1`
- `tests_generated` and `tests_passed` must be non-negative integers
- `tests_passed` must be ≤ `tests_generated`
- When `status=failed`: `error` must be present
- `summary` must be present and under 200 tokens
- **Hook-enforced (in addition to schema):** when tests were actually run (i.e. `tests_generated > 0`), `coverage_estimate` must be present. The SubagentStop hook for QA Executor enforces this conditional even though the field is otherwise optional.

## CODE_REVIEW_RESULT

Produced by Code Reviewer agent on review completion.

```yaml
CODE_REVIEW_RESULT:
  schema_version: 3                    # integer, required — v3 adds review_mode + consistency audit fields
  review_mode: enum [diff_review, consistency_audit]  # required — plan/prompt review is an audit_focus, not a mode
  audit_focus: string[]                # required — non-empty iff review_mode=consistency_audit; else []
                                       # allowed values: mirrored_prompt, metadata, counts, docs, hooks, plan_prompt
                                       # A single audit may carry multiple focus tags.
  trigger_paths_detected: string[]     # required — subset of reviewed paths matching audit trigger surfaces
                                       # (agents/, commands/, skills/, docs/, plugin.json,
                                       # hooks.json, .supervisor/jobs/, README.md, CLAUDE.md,
                                       # .claude-plugin/README.md, SKILLS_INDEX.md). Empty = no trigger fired.
                                       # INVARIANT: non-empty ⇒ review_mode MUST equal "consistency_audit".
  scope_expanded: string[]             # required — files added beyond the original diff; [] if no expansion
  files_checked: string[]              # required, non-empty — all files actually read during review
  consistency_checks:                  # required when review_mode=consistency_audit; omit otherwise
    mirrored_prompts:   enum [pass, fail, not_applicable]
    version_strings:    enum [pass, fail, not_applicable]   # authoritative-tier only
    counts:             enum [pass, fail, not_applicable]
    workflow_alignment: enum [pass, fail, not_applicable]
    hooks_parity:       enum [pass, fail, not_applicable]   # advisory; fail cannot raise severity > LOW
  consistency_summary: string          # required when review_mode=consistency_audit
  decision: enum [PASS, FAIL, NEEDS_HUMAN]  # required
  issues: object[]                     # required (can be empty for PASS)
    - severity: enum [BLOCKING, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW]
      category: enum [new, pre_existing, nit, drift]  # drift added in v3
      drift_kind: enum [version_authoritative, version_secondary, mirrored_prompt,
                        count, workflow, hooks_parity, wording]  # required when category=drift
      file: string                     # file path
      line: integer                    # optional — line number
      description: string              # what's wrong
      suggestion: string               # optional — how to fix
  pattern_proposals: object[]          # optional — patterns for CLAUDE.md
    - pattern: string
      file: string
      description: string
  summary: string                      # required — concise review summary
```

**Validation rules (schema_version: 3):**
- `schema_version` must equal `3` (v2 still accepted for backward compatibility / legacy agent memory)
- `review_mode` must be one of: `diff_review`, `consistency_audit`
- `audit_focus` is required; non-empty iff `review_mode == consistency_audit`; each element ∈ {mirrored_prompt, metadata, counts, docs, hooks, plan_prompt}
- `trigger_paths_detected` is required (may be empty)
- **Cross-field invariant:** if `trigger_paths_detected` is non-empty → `review_mode` MUST equal `consistency_audit`
- `files_checked` must be a non-empty array
- `scope_expanded` must be present (may be empty for `diff_review`)
- When `review_mode == consistency_audit`: `consistency_checks` object with all 5 sub-keys present; `consistency_summary` non-empty
- `decision` must be one of: `PASS`, `FAIL`, `NEEDS_HUMAN`
- Each issue must include `category` ∈ {new, pre_existing, nit, drift}
- When `category == drift`: `drift_kind` required
- **`drift_kind` severity caps are enforced** (issues violating these caps are rejected):
  - `drift_kind ∈ {count, version_secondary}` → severity MUST be `≤ MEDIUM`
  - `drift_kind ∈ {hooks_parity, wording}` → severity MUST be `≤ LOW`
  - `drift_kind ∈ {version_authoritative, mirrored_prompt, workflow}` → no cap
- When `decision=FAIL`: `issues` must contain at least one issue with `category ∈ {new, drift}` AND severity ∈ {BLOCKING, HIGH}. Because of the caps above, `count`, `version_secondary`, `hooks_parity`, and `wording` drift cannot satisfy FAIL on their own
- When `decision=NEEDS_HUMAN`: `issues` must be non-empty
- `summary` must be present

**Validation rules (schema_version: 2, legacy):**
- `schema_version` must equal `2`
- `decision` must be one of: `PASS`, `FAIL`, `NEEDS_HUMAN`
- When `decision=FAIL`: `issues` must contain at least one `new` issue with BLOCKING or HIGH severity
- When `decision=NEEDS_HUMAN`: `issues` must be non-empty
- Each issue must include `category` ∈ {new, pre_existing, nit}
- Only `new` issues with BLOCKING/HIGH severity can trigger FAIL
- `summary` must be present

**Migration notes (v2 → v3):**
- v3 introduces review modes and a repo-consistency audit contract. Existing v2 producers remain valid.
- The `drift` category and `drift_kind` enum make consistency-audit findings first-class issues rather than free-text notes, and the severity caps prevent advisory drift (counts, hooks parity, wording) from blocking PRs.
- Plan/prompt review is represented as `audit_focus: plan_prompt` (not a distinct `review_mode`), so a single audit touching both prompts and metadata emits one result with multiple focus tags instead of requiring mode precedence rules.
- The `trigger_paths_detected` ↔ `review_mode` cross-field invariant is what makes the new hook enforcement possible: the reviewer is accountable to its own self-report of which trigger surfaces the diff touched.

## PLAN_REVIEW_RESULT

Produced by Plan Reviewer agent when validating a Supervisor-Ready Brief (Launch Pad Phase 5.5).

```yaml
PLAN_REVIEW_RESULT:
  schema_version: 1                    # integer, required
  decision: enum [PASS, FAIL, NEEDS_HUMAN]  # required
  issues: object[]                     # required (can be empty for PASS)
    - severity: enum [BLOCKING, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW]
      section: string                  # brief section name (e.g., "Subtask Structure", "File Impact Map")
      category: string                 # optional — issue category (e.g., "dep_graph" for Criterion 12 violations, "file_path" for missing files); free-form, but use canonical names where defined
      description: string              # what's wrong
      suggestion: string               # optional — how to fix
  summary: string                      # required — concise review summary
```

**Validation rules:**
- `schema_version` must equal `1`
- `decision` must be one of: `PASS`, `FAIL`, `NEEDS_HUMAN`
- When `decision=FAIL`: `issues` must contain at least one issue with BLOCKING or HIGH severity
- When `decision=NEEDS_HUMAN`: `issues` must be non-empty
- `section` must reference a valid brief section name
- `category` is optional but recommended; when present, prefer canonical names — `dep_graph` for Criterion 12 (provides/requires) violations, `file_path` for missing-file violations, `feasibility` for Criterion 11 issues
- `summary` must be present

**Severity mapping for plan review:**
- BLOCKING: Missing/nonexistent file paths, missing required brief sections
- HIGH: Incorrect dependencies, unsafe parallelism (false LAUNCHABLE), logic errors
- MEDIUM: Vague acceptance criteria, missing skill references, incomplete risk assessment
- LOW: Style improvements, optional enhancements

## LAUNCH_PAD_RESULT

Produced by Launch Pad at the end of its workflow (after Phase 6 SAVE) to communicate the outcome and — critically — the **exact path of the saved Supervisor-Ready Brief** for programmatic consumers (notably `/autonomous` PLAN phase, which previously relied on a fragile `ls`-diff of `.supervisor/jobs/pending/`).

**Added in v13.1.0.** Emission is non-blocking for v1 — the schema is purely additive. Existing Launch Pad consumers (the user who reads the markdown output) are unaffected; new consumers (`/autonomous`) read the structured block from the transcript or the SubagentStop hook payload when Launch Pad runs in `-runner` mode (`claude --agent ai-agent-manager-plugin:launch-pad-runner`).

```yaml
LAUNCH_PAD_RESULT:
  schema_version: 1                    # integer, required — always 1
  status: enum [saved, discarded, blocked, aborted]  # required
  saved_brief_path: string | null      # required field, value is null unless status=saved
  summary: string                      # required — one-line outcome (≤ 200 chars recommended)
```

**Validation rules (schema_version: 1):**
- `schema_version` must equal `1`
- `status` must be one of: `saved` | `discarded` | `blocked` | `aborted`
- `saved_brief_path`:
  - When `status: saved` → MUST be a non-empty string matching `.supervisor/jobs/pending/*.md`. Path must exist on disk at the moment the block is emitted (the brief file having been written in Phase 6).
  - When `status ∈ {discarded, blocked, aborted}` → MUST be `null` (the literal YAML `null`, not the string `"null"` or an empty string).
- `summary` must be a non-empty string.

**Status semantics:**
- **`saved`** — Phase 6 completed and the user chose "Save and exit" (or "Override and save" for NEEDS_HUMAN paths). The brief file exists on disk.
- **`discarded`** — Phase 6 completed and the user chose "Discard". No file written.
- **`blocked`** — Phase 1 BLOCKERS surfaced (environment, etc.) or Plan Review FAILed × 3 with no user override path; save was never offered.
- **`aborted`** — User aborted the workflow mid-flight (e.g., killed the session, `/autonomous` cleanup-after-rubric-dropped); no save and no clean Phase 6 outcome.

**Emission cadence:** the block is emitted **once per Launch Pad invocation**, immediately after Phase 6 completes (whether the file was written or not). Whether the agent runs via the `/launch-pad` slash command (inline on the main thread) or via `claude --agent ai-agent-manager-plugin:launch-pad-runner` (agent-owned session), the same single emission happens. The SubagentStop hook validates the block only in the agent-owned path; for the inline slash-command path, programmatic consumers (e.g., the autonomous-loop skill) read the last emitted `LAUNCH_PAD_RESULT` block from the transcript, mirroring the `SUPERVISOR_RESULT` pattern.

**Example (status: saved):**
```yaml
LAUNCH_PAD_RESULT:
  schema_version: 1
  status: saved
  saved_brief_path: .supervisor/jobs/pending/2026-05-28-add-version-command.md
  summary: Plan Review PASS on attempt 1/3; saved Supervisor-Ready Brief for /supervisor handoff.
```

**Example (status: discarded):**
```yaml
LAUNCH_PAD_RESULT:
  schema_version: 1
  status: discarded
  saved_brief_path: null
  summary: User chose Discard at Phase 6 after reviewing the assembled brief.
```

**Example (status: blocked):**
```yaml
LAUNCH_PAD_RESULT:
  schema_version: 1
  status: blocked
  saved_brief_path: null
  summary: Phase 1 surfaced BLOCKER — required tool `bd` not installed; save not offered.
```

**Consumer pattern (`/autonomous` PLAN phase):** read `LAUNCH_PAD_RESULT.saved_brief_path` directly as the iteration's `current_brief_path` when `status: saved`. When `status ∈ {discarded, blocked, aborted}`, exit the autonomous loop with the corresponding terminal status. The `ls`-diff fallback (Launch Pad pre-v13.1.0) remains supported during the transition window but is no longer the primary detection mechanism.

**Why a single new field beyond the standard three (`schema_version`, `status`, `summary`):** the temptation to add `feasibility`, `plan_review_attempts`, `rubric_preserved`, etc. is real — but each new field is one more validation invariant the SubagentStop hook must police, and the CODE_REVIEW_RESULT v2 → v3 migration (which now carries ~600 words of validation logic, see `hooks.json`) is the cautionary tale. v1 stays exactly four fields total. Future additions land in their own follow-up plans with explicit leverage rationale.

## CONTEXT_KEEPER_STATE

Schema for `.supervisor/state.md` managed by Context-Keeper.

```yaml
version: integer                       # required — monotonic counter, increments on every write
current_phase: enum [INIT, ACQUIRE, PLAN, EXECUTE, FINALIZE, SELF_HEAL, LOOP]  # required
session_id: string                     # required — unique session identifier
task_id: string                        # required — current task being worked on
task_title: string                     # optional — human-readable task description
branch: string                         # required after ACQUIRE — feature branch name
config:
  max_workers: integer                 # default 2
  mode: enum [parallel, sequential]    # default parallel
  cost_profile: enum [default, cheap]  # optional — default "default"; set from --cheap flag at INIT
active_subtasks: object[]              # required during EXECUTE
  - id: string
    status: enum [pending, in_progress, completed, failed]
    worktree_path: string              # optional — only for parallel mode
    branch: string                     # optional — subtask branch
    agent_id: string                   # optional — Task agent ID
completed_subtasks: string[]           # subtask IDs that are done
failed_subtasks: string[]              # subtask IDs that failed
worktrees: object[]                    # active worktree tracking
  - task_id: string
    path: string
    branch: string
    status: enum [active, merged, cleaned, failed]
agents_running: object[]               # currently spawned agents
  - agent_type: string                 # e.g., "worker", "code-reviewer"
    task_id: string
    started_at: timestamp
self_heal_resume_count: integer        # optional — default 0; increments only on resumes that actually execute the code-reviewer Task in Phase 4.5 (first loop iteration), NOT on every --continue landing in SELF_HEAL. Phase 4.5 invariant-violation resumes (code-reviewer never invoked AND --skip-self-heal not set) deliberately do NOT increment, so they cannot age into a self_heal_resume_thrash escalation. Resets to 0 in the SELF_HEAL completion tail on the three completion exit paths (PASS, ESCALATED, or loop-skipped via --skip-self-heal); the invariant-violation guard (step 0) exits with status: failed before reaching the reset step and deliberately does NOT reset, preserving prior legitimate reviewer-reaching counts. Thrash guard: if the counter reaches 3, Supervisor aborts the loop and escalates with self_heal_resume_thrash reason. Lazy-added on first SELF_HEAL resume that runs the reviewer; mutated via record_self_heal_resume operation; read non-mutatively via query(section: session).
last_updated: timestamp                # required — ISO 8601
```

**Phase note:** `SELF_HEAL` (added in v11.0.0) is the post-FINALIZE holistic review + bounded fix loop. Entered after PR creation; exits to LOOP after PASS or ESCALATED outcome, or when `--skip-self-heal` short-circuits the review loop (completion tail still runs).

**Validation rules:**
- `version` starts at 1 and monotonically increases on every write
- `current_phase` must be one of: `INIT`, `ACQUIRE`, `PLAN`, `EXECUTE`, `FINALIZE`, `SELF_HEAL`, `LOOP`
- `last_updated` must be in ISO 8601 format
- `active_subtasks` required when `current_phase = EXECUTE`
- `branch` required after `ACQUIRE` phase (all subsequent phases)
- `session_id` and `task_id` must be non-empty strings

## QA_SESSION

Schema for `.qa-session/plan.json` and `.qa-session/coverage.json` managed by QA Executor during session-based testing.

### plan.json

```yaml
QA_SESSION_PLAN:
  schema_version: 1                    # integer, required — always 1
  created: string                      # required — ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  app_url: string                      # required — base URL of the application
  total_routes: integer                # required — total routes discovered
  total_apis: integer                  # required — total API endpoints discovered

  scopes: object[]                     # required — non-empty array of feature scopes
    - name: string                     # required — scope identifier (e.g., "auth", "tournaments")
      routes: string[]                 # required — route paths in this scope
      apis: string[]                   # required — API endpoints in this scope (e.g., "POST /api/auth/login")
      risk: enum [HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW]   # required — highest risk route in scope
      priority: integer                # required — 1 = highest priority
      status: enum [pending, in_progress, completed, failed, skipped]  # required
      estimated_tests: integer         # required — estimated test count for this scope
      completed_at: string             # optional — ISO timestamp when scope was completed
```

**Validation rules:**
- `schema_version` must equal `1`
- `scopes` must be non-empty array
- Each scope must have unique `name`
- `priority` must be unique across scopes
- `status` starts as `pending` for all scopes

### coverage.json

```yaml

```

**Validation rules:**
- `routes_tested` must be ≤ `routes_total`
- `apis_tested` must be ≤ `apis_total`
- `scopes_completed` + `scopes_remaining` must equal total scope count

## AUTONOMOUS_RUN

Emitted by the `/autonomous` inline main-thread workflow (v13.0.0+). Written to `.supervisor/autonomous/{session_id}/summary.md` (human-readable markdown) with a machine-readable sidecar at `.supervisor/autonomous/{session_id}/state.json`. Also echoed to main-thread output for user visibility.

**Not subject to hook validation.** `AUTONOMOUS_RUN` is autonomous-layer-only; the existing `hooks/hooks.json` SubagentStop validators target `SUPERVISOR_RESULT`, `WORKER_RESULT`, etc., and explicitly do *not* validate `AUTONOMOUS_RUN`. The status enum is intentionally distinct from `SUPERVISOR_RESULT.status` (`completed | completed_with_escalation | failed | checkpoint`) to prevent confusion and to keep the two layers separable.

```yaml
AUTONOMOUS_RUN:
  schema_version: 1                    # integer, required — always 1
  session_id: string                   # required — "auto-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{HHMMSS}". v1 second-precision is sufficient under the single-session assumption; v2 may append a random suffix (e.g., "-{4hex}") to harden against same-second collisions when concurrent sessions are supported.
  requirement_path: string             # required — path to the requirement file under .supervisor/requirements/
  mode: enum [single, multi]           # required — single-iteration (default) or opt-in --allow-multi-iteration
  allow_multi_iteration: boolean       # required — true iff --allow-multi-iteration was passed; redundant with `mode == "multi"` but explicit for readers who index on the flag name
  max_iterations: integer              # required — the cap that was in effect for this run (1..N). For single-iteration runs (mode == "single"), this field MUST be 1 — the implicit cap. For multi-iteration runs, it carries the --max-iterations value (default 3). Recording this makes runs that end with status: paused_max_iterations self-diagnosable: a reader can tell whether the cap was the default 3 or a user-supplied custom value.
  status: enum [done, paused_max_iterations, aborted, failed]  # required — autonomous-layer status
  status_reason: string | null         # required — null when status: done AND no rubric stop; otherwise one of the documented reason strings (see below)
  total_iterations: integer            # required — 0..max_iterations (0 when the loop aborted during PLAN before any EXECUTE)
  last_phase: enum [PLAN, EXECUTE, EVALUATE, DONE]  # required — phase the loop was in at exit
  started_at: string                   # required — ISO-8601 UTC timestamp
  ended_at: string                     # required — ISO-8601 UTC timestamp
  duration_seconds: integer            # required — `ended_at - started_at`, rounded to the nearest second. v1 uses integer precision because the loop is foreground-assisted and human-paced (multi-iteration runs span minutes to hours); sub-second precision is not actionable. If telemetry ever aggregates sub-minute autonomous sessions, a v2 schema bump can widen this to `number` without breaking existing parsers (integer is a valid JSON number).
  iterations: object[]                 # required — one entry per iteration that reached EXECUTE (may be empty array [] for pre-EXECUTE aborts: Phase 6 discard, NO-GO abort, Plan Review FAIL × 3 abort)
    - n: integer                       # 1-indexed
      brief_path: string               # path to the brief Launch Pad saved; lifecycle-moved by Supervisor
      supervisor_status: enum [completed, completed_with_escalation, failed, checkpoint]  # normally mirrors `SUPERVISOR_RESULT.status`. EXCEPTION: when Supervisor exited without emitting a `SUPERVISOR_RESULT` block at all (crash, hard API error, etc.), the autonomous loop synthesizes this iteration entry with `supervisor_status: failed` and `error: "no_supervisor_result_emitted"` — see `skills/autonomous-loop/SKILL.md` EXECUTE step 5 for the synthesis algorithm. The enum value is the same in both cases; only the provenance differs.
      pr_url: string | null            # SUPERVISOR_RESULT.pr_url when present
      rubric_score: string | null      # SUPERVISOR_RESULT.rubric_score when present (format "N/M")
      branch: string                   # normally `SUPERVISOR_RESULT.branch`. EXCEPTION: the synthetic no-SUPERVISOR_RESULT entry uses the empty string `""` because no branch name was emitted — the iteration crashed before Supervisor produced a result block, so the loop has no authoritative branch to record. The empty string is a deliberate sentinel; merge verification on Signal 1 skips the local-ancestor fallback when `branch == ""` (see `skills/autonomous-loop/SKILL.md` Signal 1 merge-verification block, which already treats unresolvable branch SHAs as "merge unverifiable" and re-prompts the user).

```

**`status_reason` enum** (documented as a closed set; new values require updating both this schema and `skills/autonomous-loop/SKILL.md`). The mapping between `status` and the legal subset of `status_reason` values is fixed:

| `status` | Legal `status_reason` values |
|---|---|
| `done` | `null` (rubric satisfied or no rubric present) **OR** `"user_stopped_at_rubric_gate"` (user accepted partial rubric; PR exists, run ended on user's terms) |
| `paused_max_iterations` | `"max_iterations_reached"` |
| `aborted` | `"user_discarded_at_phase_6"`, `"user_aborted_at_no_go"`, `"user_aborted_at_plan_review_fail"`, `"supervisor_checkpoint"`, `"rubric_dropped_from_brief"`, `"concurrent_session_detected"`, `"invalid_max_iterations"` |
| `failed` | `"supervisor_failed_other"` |

Reason-string meanings:

- `null` — `status: done` with rubric satisfied or no rubric present
- `"max_iterations_reached"` — multi-iteration mode hit the `--max-iterations` cap
- `"user_discarded_at_phase_6"` — user picked "discard" at Launch Pad's Phase 6 save prompt (pre-EXECUTE; `total_iterations == 0`, `iterations == []`)
- `"user_aborted_at_no_go"` — user picked "abort" at Launch Pad Phase 2.5 NO-GO escalation (pre-EXECUTE; `total_iterations == 0`)
- `"user_aborted_at_plan_review_fail"` — user picked "abort" after Plan Reviewer FAIL × 3 (pre-EXECUTE; `total_iterations == 0`)
- `"user_stopped_at_rubric_gate"` — user picked "stop-here" at the rubric-gate AskUserQuestion. The latest iteration's PR exists and Supervisor returned `completed`; the run ends successfully but with `rubric_score N<M` recorded in `rubric_final_score`. Pairs with `status: done` (not `aborted`) because nothing went wrong — the user accepted partial completion.
- `"supervisor_checkpoint"` — `SUPERVISOR_RESULT.status: checkpoint` (loop does not auto-resume in v1)
- `"supervisor_failed_other"` — covers two cases: (a) `SUPERVISOR_RESULT.status: failed` was emitted but without the `inter_subtask_gap` Option-C signal in any of the three iteration-scoped sources; (b) Supervisor crashed or otherwise exited without emitting any `SUPERVISOR_RESULT` block at all, and the autonomous loop synthesized a placeholder iteration entry with `error: "no_supervisor_result_emitted"` so the schema's `iterations.length == total_iterations` invariant still holds
- `"rubric_dropped_from_brief"` — Launch Pad did not preserve the `## Outcomes Rubric` section (rubric-preservation gate failure)
- `"concurrent_session_detected"` — brief-save `ls`-diff found more than one new file in `.supervisor/jobs/pending/` (violates v1 single-session assumption)
- `"invalid_max_iterations"` — `--allow-multi-iteration` was passed with `--max-iterations N` where N is not a positive integer (N ≤ 0 or non-integer). INIT rejects this immediately, before any state.json/summary.md is written beyond the abort record. `total_iterations: 0`, `iterations: []`, `last_phase: PLAN`

**Validation rules:**
- No SubagentStop hook validates this block (autonomous-layer-only).
- `iterations.length == total_iterations` (when `total_iterations == 0`, `iterations` MUST be an empty array `[]`; this is the pre-EXECUTE-abort case).
- `total_iterations >= 0` and `total_iterations <= max_iterations`. The pre-EXECUTE-abort paths (`user_discarded_at_phase_6`, `user_aborted_at_no_go`, `user_aborted_at_plan_review_fail`) all yield `total_iterations == 0`.
- `status` ↔ `status_reason` pairing must follow the table above. In particular, `status: done` is valid with either `status_reason: null` (clean completion) or `status_reason: "user_stopped_at_rubric_gate"` (user accepted partial rubric); no other reason string is legal with `done`.
- When `total_iterations == 0`, `rubric_final_score` MUST be `null` and `last_phase` MUST be `PLAN`.
- When `total_iterations >= 1`, `rubric_final_score` mirrors the `rubric_score` of the last entry in `iterations`.
- Each `policy_decisions[]` entry's `decision` field MUST match a value from the closed `decision` enum in the YAML schema above. Each `(decision, source)` pair MUST follow the legal pairing table below.

**`policy_decisions.decision` enum** (closed set; new values require updating both this schema and `skills/autonomous-loop/SKILL.md`). The legal `(decision, source)` pairing table:

| `decision` | Legal `source` value | Captures |
|---|---|---|
| `"user_picked_save"` | `launch_pad_phase_6` | User confirmed brief save at Launch Pad Phase 6 |
| `"user_picked_discard"` | `launch_pad_phase_6` | User discarded brief at Launch Pad Phase 6 (terminal — produces `status: aborted`) |
| `"user_picked_override"` | `launch_pad_no_go`, `launch_pad_plan_review` | User overrode a NO-GO verdict or a Plan Review FAIL (loop continues) |
| `"user_picked_abort"` | `launch_pad_no_go`, `launch_pad_plan_review` | User aborted at NO-GO or after Plan Review FAIL × 3 (terminal — produces `status: aborted`) |
| `"user_picked_merge_and_continue"` | `autonomous_rubric_gate` | User confirmed merge and asked loop to proceed; merge-verified before re-plan |
| `"user_picked_stop_here"` | `autonomous_rubric_gate` | User accepted partial rubric (terminal — produces `status: done, status_reason: user_stopped_at_rubric_gate`) |
| `"user_picked_force_continue_anyway"` | `autonomous_rubric_gate` | User bypassed merge verification (loop continues; conflict risk recorded for audit) |
| `"supervisor_option_c_detected"` | `supervisor_adjudication` | **Loop-inferred from filesystem evidence** after Supervisor's own adjudication AskUserQuestion concluded. Unlike the `user_picked_*` entries, this decision was made inside Supervisor's session — the autonomous loop only records that it observed the result (failed brief in `.supervisor/jobs/failed/` + `inter_subtask_gap` substring). The `_detected` suffix is a deliberate naming convention to flag this distinction for future tooling. |

## Schema Versioning

All result schemas include a `schema_version` field. This enables forward compatibility:

1. Hooks check `schema_version` before validating fields
2. If `schema_version` is unrecognized, hook warns but does not block
3. New fields can be added without breaking existing validation
4. Breaking changes require incrementing `schema_version`

### Version History

- **SUPERVISOR_RESULT v1 extension** (v12.2.0): Added optional `rubric_score: string | null` field. Format is `"N/M"` where N is a non-negative integer (`>= 0`; `"0/M"` is the legitimate all-fail case where the grader ran but every rubric item failed), M is a positive integer (`>= 1`), and M ≥ N — OR `null`. The two non-null forms are semantically distinct: `null` = grader did not run; `"0/M"` = grader ran and zero items passed. Populated by the Phase 4.5 Haiku grader when the brief contains an `## Outcomes Rubric` section AND `heal_decision == PASS`; `null` otherwise. Schema version was NOT bumped because the addition is optional and additive — pre-v12.2.0 producers and consumers continue to validate without change. The Supervisor SubagentStop hook accepts presence or absence and only validates format when present.
- **AUTONOMOUS_RUN v1** (v13.0.0): New schema for the `/autonomous` orchestration shell's summary block. Autonomous-layer-only — no SubagentStop hook validates it (the autonomous workflow is an inline main-thread chain, not a delegated agent). Status enum (`done | paused_max_iterations | aborted | failed`) is intentionally disjoint from `SUPERVISOR_RESULT.status` to keep the two layers separable. Status-reason enum is closed; new values require updating both this schema and `skills/autonomous-loop/SKILL.md`.
- **WORKER_RESULT v2** (v12.0.0): Added `outputs_verified[]` (itemized presence checks for every output the brief promised) and `outputs_gap` (string; non-empty implies status MUST be `partial`). The SubagentStop hook enforces a cross-field invariant: `outputs_gap` non-empty AND `status: completed` is rejected. v1 emissions remain accepted during the v12.0.0 transition window.
- **EXECUTE_CHECKPOINT v1 extension** (v12.0.0): Added optional fields `adjudication_required: bool`, `missing_outputs: object[]`, and `adjudication_options: string[]`. These fields appear together (all-or-nothing); when `adjudication_required: true`, both arrays MUST be non-empty (hook-enforced). Schema version was NOT bumped because the additions are optional. Same release added a hook rejection of `toolset_gap`-style escalation reasons.
- **CODE_REVIEW_RESULT v2** (v7.0.0): Added `category` field to issues (`new`, `pre_existing`, `nit`). FAIL decisions now require at least one `new` HIGH/BLOCKING issue. Pre-existing issues are reported but do not block.
- **MISSING_FUNCTIONALITY_REPORT v1** (v7.1.0): New schema for QA Executor gap detection output.
- **QA_RESULT + QA_SESSION_PLAN** (v10.3.0): Added optional `app_topology`, `detected_auth_method`, `websocket_detected` (QA_RESULT) and `app_topology`, `auth_method` (QA_SESSION_PLAN). Backward compatible — existing payloads without these fields still validate.
- **QA_RESULT contract fixes** (v10.3.0): `status` enum expanded to include `needs_human` (matches executor/blueprint usage). `bugs_found` reclassified as integer count (was object[]); detailed bug records now live in new optional `bugs` field. `bugs_blocking` integer added. Added missing fields to formalize executor emissions: `tests_run_this_session`, `depth`, `environment`, `discovery_warnings`, `coverage`, `coverage_weighted`, `risk_score`, `interaction_coverage`, `discovery_gaps`, `environment_issues`, `notes`. Resolves prior doc/contract drift.
- **MISSING_FUNCTIONALITY_REPORT** (v10.3.0): `gaps` may be `[]` when analysis finds nothing. Emission is always required — absent block means Phase 4.5 was skipped.
- **GRAPHQL_RISK_OVERRIDES** (v10.3.0): New output contract emitted by QA Strategist in Strategy Mode when `api_style` is `graphql` or `mixed`.
- All other schemas remain at v1.

## MISSING_FUNCTIONALITY_REPORT

Produced by QA Executor during Phase 4.5 gap analysis. Separate from QA_RESULT.

```yaml
MISSING_FUNCTIONALITY_REPORT:
  schema_version: 1                    # integer, required — always 1
  task_id: string                      # required — QA run identifier
  gaps: object[]                       # required — MAY be empty. An empty array with total_gaps: 0 is valid and means "analysis ran, no gaps found"
    - category: enum [missing_crud, missing_pagination, missing_search,
                      missing_validation, missing_error_handling, missing_confirmation,
                      missing_loading_state, missing_rate_limiting,
                      data_integrity_risk, security_boundary_gap, best_practice_gap]
      severity: enum [CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW]
      location: string                 # route/endpoint/component where gap found
      description: string              # what's missing and why it matters
      evidence: string                 # what discovery data led to this conclusion
      recommendation: string           # what should be built/fixed
  summary: string                      # required — concise summary of all gaps
  total_gaps: integer                  # required — total gap count
  critical_count: integer              # required — CRITICAL gaps count
```

**Validation rules:**
- **Always emit the report** — even when `gaps` is empty. Absence of the block means Phase 4.5 was skipped (Strategist will reject).
- `gaps` MAY be `[]` (empty). When empty, `total_gaps` MUST be `0` and `critical_count` MUST be `0`.
- Each gap (when present) must have `category`, `severity`, `location`, `description`
- `total_gaps` must equal `gaps.length`
- `critical_count` must equal count of gaps with `severity=CRITICAL`
- `summary` must be present (e.g., "No gaps detected." for empty report)

**Example:**
```
MISSING_FUNCTIONALITY_REPORT:
  schema_version: 1
  task_id: qa-run-2026-03-22
  gaps:
    - category: missing_crud
      severity: HIGH
      location: POST /api/tournaments
      description: Tournament entity has create endpoint but no edit (PUT) or delete (DELETE)
      evidence: Discovery found POST /api/tournaments but no PUT or DELETE for same resource
      recommendation: Add PUT /api/tournaments/:id and DELETE /api/tournaments/:id endpoints
    - category: missing_rate_limiting
      severity: HIGH
      location: POST /api/auth/login
      description: Login endpoint has no rate limiting — brute force attack vector
      evidence: 5 rapid requests all returned 200 with no 429 response
      recommendation: Add rate limiting (max 5 attempts per minute per IP)
    - category: missing_pagination
      severity: MEDIUM
      location: GET /api/tournaments
      description: List endpoint returns all items with no pagination support
      evidence: No limit/offset/page query parameters detected in API calls
      recommendation: Add pagination with limit/offset or cursor-based approach
  summary: 3 gaps found (2 HIGH, 1 MEDIUM). Missing CRUD operations and rate limiting are highest priority.
  total_gaps: 3
  critical_count: 0
```

## GRAPHQL_RISK_OVERRIDES

Produced by QA Strategist in Strategy Mode **only when `api_style` is `graphql` or `mixed`**.
Consumed by QA Executor in Phase 7 write-back to persist per-operation risk into `discovery/api-calls.json`.

This is a markdown-table contract (not YAML) because it appears inline in the Strategist's textual output. The Executor parses it by header row match.

### Format

```markdown
### GraphQL Risk Overrides

| Operation | Method | Risk | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| createUser | MUTATION | HIGH | auth + data mutation |
| getUsers | QUERY | MEDIUM | (default) |
| deleteOrg | MUTATION | HIGH | destructive, admin-only |
| healthCheck | QUERY | LOW | no side effects |
```

### Validation Rules

- Heading must contain the literal text `GraphQL Risk Overrides` (case-insensitive)
- Table columns MUST be `Operation | Method | Risk | Reason` in this order
- Match key into `api-calls.json` is `Operation` + `Method` together (a query and mutation can share the same name — method disambiguates)
- `Method` values: `QUERY` | `MUTATION` (uppercase)
- `Risk` values: `HIGH` | `MEDIUM` | `LOW`
- `Reason` is free-form human-readable text (not parsed by machines)
- Block is **omitted entirely** when `api_style` is not `graphql`/`mixed` — absence is not an error
- If block is absent for a graphql app: Phase 5B default risks stand (no write-back performed)

### Write-back Behavior (Executor)

For each row in the table:
1. Match by `Operation` + `Method` against entries in `discovery/api-calls.json`
2. If row's `Risk` differs from entry's current `risk`: update the entry's `risk` field via Edit
3. If row has no matching entry: log warning, skip (Strategist may have hallucinated an operation)
4. Operations in `api-calls.json` not listed in the override table: keep existing Phase 5B default

Executor updates `api-calls.json` in-place; no separate overrides file is persisted.

---

## Validation Location

Schema validation occurs in the **hook execution layer**:
- Per-agent `SubagentStop` hooks (in agent frontmatter) validate Worker and Execute Manager results
- Cross-cutting `SubagentStop` hooks (in `hooks.json`) validate Code Reviewer and QA Executor results
- Validation is never duplicated in Supervisor or plugin runtime
