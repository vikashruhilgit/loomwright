# Telemetry — GitHub Issues as Storage

**Status:** Initial design draft (Subtask #1). Architecture diagram, post-implementation
authoritative tables, and the no-default-repo subsection will be expanded in Subtask #5
once the wrapper, core, and `/telemetry` slash command land.

---

## Overview

Telemetry is an **opt-in**, structured feedback channel that turns finished
agent runs (`SUPERVISOR_RESULT`, `CODE_REVIEW_RESULT`, `QA_RESULT`) into GitHub
issues in a target repo of the user's choice. Each issue carries a derived
score, a labelled categorisation, and a redacted JSON payload. The goal is
longitudinal analysis: identify weak agents, find recurring failure modes,
and improve prompts and skills over many runs.

The system is:

- **Opt-in only.** Disabled until the user explicitly runs `/telemetry enable`
  or sets the `AI_AGENT_MANAGER_TELEMETRY_REPO` env var.
- **Storage-free for the plugin.** No backend. GitHub Issues is the database;
  labels are the index.
- **Hook-driven, fire-and-forget.** A `SubagentStop` hook invokes a wrapper
  shell script. The wrapper never blocks the agent run — it always exits 0.
- **Privacy-first.** A regex deny-list inside the core script blocks any
  payload that looks like a secret, file path, email, or `.env` content.
- **Deterministic.** The same result block scored twice produces the same
  number — no randomness, no timestamps in the score function.

Out of scope for the initial implementation (tracked in
[Future Work](#future-work) below): session-level batch issues, weekly
summary bots, and any backend service.

---

## Architecture

The system is split into a **wrapper** and a **core** to satisfy two
otherwise-contradictory requirements:

1. The hook contract requires the script to never fail the agent run
   (always exit 0).
2. Privacy and configuration violations must fail closed (refuse to send,
   exit non-zero, leave an audit trail).

The split lets each script honour exactly one of those requirements.

```
SubagentStop hook (hooks.json)
       |
       | stdin: JSON payload from Claude Code
       v
[ ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/send-telemetry.sh ]   <-- WRAPPER
       |   - pipes stdin to core
       |   - captures core's exit code + stderr
       |   - redacts stderr through the privacy whitelist
       |   - appends one structured line to .supervisor/logs/telemetry.log
       |   - opportunistically reaps stale per-session flags (>24h)
       |   - ALWAYS exits 0
       v
[ ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/send-telemetry-core.sh ]   <-- CORE
       - parses inbound result block
       - resolves consent + target repo
       - applies interest filter and dedup
       - runs privacy whitelist (fail-closed)
       - derives score per the rubric below
       - formats issue body + labels
       - calls `gh issue create`
       - writes to telemetry-sent.log on success
       - exits 0..5 per the contract below
```

> **Diagram note:** This sketch will be promoted to a fuller diagram
> in Subtask #5 alongside the post-implementation polish.

### Script-location convention

- `ai-agent-manager-plugin/scripts/` — **plugin-runtime** scripts shipped
  with the plugin and invoked at agent runtime. Telemetry's wrapper, core,
  test harness, and fixtures all live here. (This is the source-tree
  layout. Hooks and slash commands MUST reference these scripts via
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/...` — that env var is set by Claude
  Code for plugin-distributed hooks/commands and resolves to the plugin
  install dir on both dev checkouts and marketplace installs. Hard-coded
  `ai-agent-manager-plugin/...` paths under `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` only
  resolve for the plugin maintainer working from this repo's checkout.)
- Repo-root `scripts/` — **release/CI tooling** only (e.g.
  `validate-version.sh`, `check-command-sync.sh`). Do NOT add runtime
  scripts at repo root; consistency audits will flag the drift.

---

## Core exit codes (authoritative)

The core is the only script that may exit non-zero. The wrapper logs the
core's exit code and always returns 0 to the hook. Tests and `/telemetry status`
read these codes to decide what happened.

| Code | Name                  | Meaning                                                                                  |
|------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0    | `sent`                | Issue successfully created via `gh issue create`. One line appended to `telemetry-sent.log`. |
| 1    | `generic_error`       | Unexpected failure (e.g. `gh` not authed, network error, malformed JSON from `gh`). Logged with redacted stderr. |
| 2    | `privacy_blocked`     | Privacy whitelist matched the prospective issue body or stderr; nothing was sent. Logged with the matched pattern's name only — never the matched content. |
| 3    | `no_consent`          | `.supervisor/telemetry-consent.json` is missing, set to `prompt`, or set to `no`. Wrapper rate-limits the user-facing notice to once per session. |
| 4    | `no_repo_configured`  | Neither `AI_AGENT_MANAGER_TELEMETRY_REPO` nor consent-file `telemetry_repo` is set. Wrapper logs `telemetry_repo_unset` once per session. |
| 5    | `filter_skipped`      | Interest filter, schema mismatch (`unknown_payload_skipped`), or dedup window suppressed the send. Not an error. |

The wrapper's behaviour is invariant of the core exit code: log the code,
log the redacted stderr, exit 0.

---

## Scoring rubric (deterministic, per-result-block)

The three result block schemas (`SUPERVISOR_RESULT`, `CODE_REVIEW_RESULT`,
`QA_RESULT`) use different status enums, different counters, and different
notions of "success". A single unified mapping cannot disambiguate them, so
the rubric is expressed as **three separate tables**. The score function
selects exactly one table per call based on which result block was found.

**Determinism rule:** Same input -> same output. The score function does
not call `date`, does not read random sources, and does not depend on
filesystem ordering. Subtask #2b implements this contract verbatim.

**Bucket ranges (used by the `score:{low|medium|high}` label):**

| Bucket   | Range          |
|----------|----------------|
| `low`    | score `< 4`    |
| `medium` | `4 <= score < 8` (i.e. `4..7` inclusive) |
| `high`   | `score >= 8`   |

Lower bound is inclusive; the upper bound flips to the next bucket. (Per
spec §2 — "low < 4, medium 4-7, high 8+".)

After all adjustments, the score is **clamped to `[0, 10]`** with a floor
of `0` and ceiling of `10`. Negative deductions never push below 0.

---

### Rubric A — `SUPERVISOR_RESULT`

| Condition                                                                          | Base score |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `status == "completed"` AND `heal_decision == "PASS"` AND `heal_remaining_issues == 0` | **9** |
| `status == "completed"` AND `heal_decision == "PASS"` AND `heal_remaining_issues > 0`  | **7** |
| `status == "completed_with_escalation"`                                            | **5** |
| `status == "checkpoint"`                                                           | **4** |
| `status == "failed"`                                                               | **2** |
| Anything else (unrecognised status enum within `SUPERVISOR_RESULT`)                | **3** (defensive default; logged as `score_default_used`) |

**Adjustments (applied after base score is selected):**

| Signal                                          | Delta            |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Each item in `subtasks_failed`                  | `-0.5`           |
| `heal_remaining_issues > 0` (AND not already deducted by base) | `-0.25 * heal_remaining_issues` (max `-1.0`) |

Floor at `0`, ceiling at `10`. Round-half-up to one decimal place.

**Worked example.** `status: "completed"`, `heal_decision: "PASS"`,
`heal_remaining_issues: 0`, `subtasks_failed: ["BD-15a"]` -> base `9`
minus `0.5` = **`8.5`**. Bucket: `high`.

---

### Rubric B — `CODE_REVIEW_RESULT`

The score reflects severity of **new** issues only. `pre_existing` and
`nit` issues do not affect the score.

| Condition                                                                  | Base score |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `decision == "PASS"` AND no `new` issues at BLOCKING or HIGH severity       | **9** |
| `decision == "PASS"` AND only `new` issues at MEDIUM or LOW severity        | **7** |
| `decision == "NEEDS_HUMAN"`                                                | **4** |
| `decision == "FAIL"`                                                       | **2** |
| Anything else                                                              | **3** (defensive default) |

**Adjustments:**

| Signal                                       | Delta   |
|----------------------------------------------|---------|
| Each `new` BLOCKING issue                    | `-1.0`  |
| Each `new` HIGH issue                        | `-0.5`  |
| Each `drift` issue (any `drift_kind`)        | `-0.25` |

Floor at `0`, ceiling at `10`.

**Worked example.** `decision: "PASS"`, two `new` MEDIUM issues, zero
BLOCKING/HIGH/drift -> base `7`, no deltas -> **`7`**. Bucket: `medium`.

---

### Rubric C — `QA_RESULT`

The score is anchored to the test pass ratio, then adjusted for coverage.
If `tests_generated == 0`, the run is treated as `filter_skipped` (exit 5)
upstream and never scored.

Let `r = tests_passed / tests_generated`.

| Condition          | Base score |
|--------------------|------------|
| `r == 1.0`         | **9** |
| `0.9 <= r < 1.0`   | **7** |
| `0.7 <= r < 0.9`   | **5** |
| `r < 0.7`          | **3** |

**Adjustments:**

| Signal                              | Delta   |
|-------------------------------------|---------|
| `coverage_estimate < 0.5`           | `-1.0`  |
| `self_check_gates_passed < 5` (out of 5) | `-0.5 * (5 - passed)` |

Floor at `0`, ceiling at `10`.

**Worked example.** `tests_passed: 9`, `tests_generated: 10` -> `r = 0.9`,
base `7`. `coverage_estimate: 0.42` -> `-1.0`. Final score **`6`**.
Bucket: `medium`.

---

## Issue body template

Every issue follows the layout from `temp/self-learning.md` §1. Sections
appear in this order; sections with no data are omitted (the renderer
should not emit empty headers).

```markdown
## Task Summary
- Task Type: <agent_type, e.g. supervisor / code-reviewer / qa-executor>
- Task ID: <task_id from the result block>
- Success: <true|false — derived from status enum, see below>
- Score: <N>/10
- Bucket: <low|medium|high>

## Agent Scores
- <agent>: <sub-score>/10        (one line per sub-agent if available)
                                  (omit section entirely if no sub-scores)

## Issues Detected
- <one bullet per error / failed subtask / new BLOCKING issue / failing test name>
                                  (omit section if empty)

## AI Suggestions
- (placeholder — static text in this release; future work in §Future Work)

## Tools Used
- <one bullet per distinct agent tool / skill referenced in the run if available>
                                  (omit section if empty)

## Raw Data
\`\`\`json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "task_id": "...",
  "agent_type": "...",
  "score": 7,
  "score_bucket": "medium",
  "status": "...",
  "redacted": true,
  ...
}
\`\`\`
```

**`Success` derivation:**

- `SUPERVISOR_RESULT`: `true` iff `status == "completed"` AND `heal_decision == "PASS"`.
- `CODE_REVIEW_RESULT`: `true` iff `decision == "PASS"`.
- `QA_RESULT`: `true` iff `tests_passed == tests_generated` AND no failing gates.

**Title format (exact):**

```
[Telemetry] {agent_type} | Score: {N} | Failed: {true|false}
```

`{N}` is the integer score (round-half-up from the rubric's clamped float).
`Failed` is the inverse of `Success` above.

---

## Labels

Every issue gets at least two labels (`telemetry` + a `score:` tier).
Additional labels stack as conditions are met.

| Label                              | When applied                                                                               |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `telemetry`                        | Always.                                                                                    |
| `score:low`                        | Final score `< 4`.                                                                         |
| `score:medium`                     | Final score `4..7` (inclusive).                                                            |
| `score:high`                       | Final score `>= 8`.                                                                        |
| `task:supervisor`                  | `agent_type == "supervisor"` (matched on `SUPERVISOR_RESULT`).                             |
| `task:code-reviewer`               | `CODE_REVIEW_RESULT`.                                                                      |
| `task:qa-executor`                 | `QA_RESULT`.                                                                               |
| `agent:{name}-weak`                | When any sub-score `< 5`. `{name}` is the sub-agent identifier (lowercased, dash-separated). E.g. `agent:planner-weak`. |

Label creation is the issuer's responsibility — Subtask #2b should
`gh label create --force` (idempotent) before `gh issue create`, so missing
labels in the target repo don't fail the send.

---

## Consent flow (no-prompt-in-hook)

A `type: command` hook **cannot** drive an interactive prompt. Therefore
the hook never asks the user anything. First-run UX is mediated entirely
by the user invoking `/telemetry enable`. This is the only design that is
actually runnable with Claude Code hooks.

### Consent file schema (`.supervisor/telemetry-consent.json`)

```json
{
  "telemetry": "always_allow" | "no" | "prompt",
  "telemetry_repo": "<owner>/<repo>"
}
```

Both fields are required when present, with these semantics:

| `telemetry` value | Behaviour                                                                                              |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `always_allow`    | Send (subject to interest filter, dedup, privacy, target-repo resolution).                             |
| `no`              | Never send. One `denied — skipped` line per session (rate-limited).                                    |
| `prompt`          | Treated as uninitialised (see below). The hook still does not prompt; the user must run `/telemetry enable`. |

If the file does not exist, behaviour is identical to `prompt`.

`telemetry_repo` is optional inside the file. The env var
`AI_AGENT_MANAGER_TELEMETRY_REPO` overrides it (see Target repo
resolution below).

### Uninitialised state — pending notice

When the hook fires and consent is uninitialised (`prompt` or file
missing), the wrapper writes **one** rate-limited line to
`.supervisor/logs/telemetry.log`:

```
telemetry pending — run `/telemetry enable` or `/telemetry disable`
```

No issue is created, no network call is made, the wrapper exits 0.

### Session-scoped rate limiting

The wrapper extracts `session_id` from the hook's stdin JSON payload
(Claude Code provides this on every hook payload — see the existing
`WorktreeCreate` block in `hooks.json:88-107` for the stdin parsing
pattern). The pending-notice marker is then a **per-session** flag file:

```
.supervisor/logs/telemetry-pending-shown-${session_id}.flag
```

- One file per session, not a single global file.
- The wrapper opportunistically reaps any
  `telemetry-pending-shown-*.flag` older than 24h on each invocation
  (`find ... -mtime +1 -delete`) so the log directory does not grow
  unboundedly.
- **Fallback:** if `session_id` is missing or empty in the stdin JSON
  (defence in depth), use a per-hour bucket flag:
  `telemetry-pending-shown-nosession-$(date +%Y%m%d%H).flag`. Worst case,
  the user sees one notice per hour from a bug-stripped payload.

The slash command `/telemetry status` reports a count of **retained**
pending markers from approximately the last 24 hours by globbing the
`telemetry-pending-shown-*.flag` files. The wording must explicitly say
"retained ~24h" — not "all-time" or "ever" — because the reaper deletes
older markers.

### `/telemetry enable` — sole first-run path

Subtask #3 implements the slash command. The handler:

1. Asks the user which repo should receive telemetry (suggesting the
   maintainer repo `vikashruhilgit/ai-agent-manager` as the canonical
   community-shared signal target, but accepting any `owner/repo`).
2. Writes:
   ```json
   { "telemetry": "always_allow", "telemetry_repo": "<chosen>" }
   ```
   to `.supervisor/telemetry-consent.json`.
3. Confirms by printing the resolved target.

`/telemetry disable` writes `{"telemetry": "no"}`. `/telemetry status` reports
the resolved state. `/telemetry test` runs `send-telemetry-core.sh --dry-run`
against either the latest matching log payload or a built-in fixture.

---

## Target repo resolution

The plugin runs in arbitrary user projects whose `origin` is the user's
own app repo. Defaulting telemetry to `origin` would post issues into the
user's repo — wrong on every axis (privacy, signal vs noise, support
burden). Therefore **telemetry is disabled by default until explicitly
configured**, and there is no `origin` fallback.

Resolution precedence (first non-empty wins):

1. Environment variable `AI_AGENT_MANAGER_TELEMETRY_REPO` (must match
   shape `owner/repo`).
2. `.supervisor/telemetry-consent.json` -> `telemetry_repo` field.
3. Unset -> core exits `4` (`no_repo_configured`); wrapper logs
   `telemetry_repo_unset — set AI_AGENT_MANAGER_TELEMETRY_REPO or run /telemetry enable to choose target` (rate-limited per session).

There is **no automatic fallback to `git remote`**. Subtask #2b must NOT
introduce one.

---

## Privacy whitelist (lives in core)

The whitelist is enforced inside `send-telemetry-core.sh`. The wrapper
does no payload inspection — it cannot, because it must always exit 0
even on privacy violations. Wrapper-side inspection would force the
contradiction the split was created to resolve.

### Deny-list (regex)

The core scans two surfaces inside `send-telemetry-core.sh`: the **raw
input payload** (every string field, before consent so privacy violations
always log even on healthy runs) AND the **prospective issue body** (the
rendered title + body + redacted JSON payload, post-render). Any single
match in either scan -> fail closed (exit 2). The core's stderr is
redacted separately by the wrapper before it lands in `telemetry.log`
(see "Stderr redaction" below) — that is defence in depth, not part of
the fail-closed check.

| Pattern (regex)                 | Catches                                          |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `sk-[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}`           | OpenAI / Anthropic-style API keys                |
| `ghp_[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}`          | GitHub personal access tokens                    |
| `api[_-]?key`                   | Generic key labels (`api_key`, `api-key`, `apikey`) |
| `Bearer\s+[A-Za-z0-9._\-]+`     | Bearer auth headers                              |
| `password\s*[:=]\s*\S+`         | Inline passwords (config-style)                  |
| `/Users/[a-zA-Z._\-]+/`         | macOS home paths (PII — usernames)               |
| `/home/[a-zA-Z._\-]+/`          | Linux home paths (PII — usernames)               |
| `[A-Za-z0-9._%+\-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.\-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}` | Email addresses |
| `^\s*[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*=.+$` (multiline) | Raw `.env` style assignments              |

Subtask #2b owns the canonical list in code; this table is the spec.
Any change to the regex set must update both this doc and the script in
the same commit (consistency audit will catch drift).

### Fail-closed behaviour

On match, the core:

1. Does **not** call `gh issue create`.
2. Writes a structured `privacy_blocked` log entry naming **which
   pattern** matched — never the matched content. Example:
   ```
   {"event":"privacy_blocked","pattern_name":"github_pat","script":"send-telemetry-core","ts":"<ISO>"}
   ```
3. Exits `2`.

### Stderr redaction

The core's stderr is captured by the wrapper (`send-telemetry.sh`) into
a tmp file, then redacted by the same whitelist BEFORE the wrapper
appends it to `telemetry.log`. The redaction lives in the wrapper, not
the core, so a runaway core script (e.g. uncaught exception printing a
traceback that includes a secret) cannot bypass it. Error messages can
themselves echo secrets (e.g. `gh`'s "401 unauthorized: ghp_..."), so
this is defence in depth on top of the body + raw-payload scans the
core already runs at lines 5-6 of the pipeline.

---

## Interest filter

To avoid spam on healthy runs, the core skips uninteresting outcomes
even when consent + target repo are configured.

**Skip (exit 5) if:** derived score `>= 5` AND status is in the success set.

| Result block         | Success set                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| `SUPERVISOR_RESULT`  | `{"completed"}` (with `heal_decision == "PASS"`) |
| `CODE_REVIEW_RESULT` | `{"PASS"}`                   |
| `QA_RESULT`          | `tests_passed == tests_generated` AND all gates passed |

**Send if:** derived score `< 5` OR status is in the interesting set:

| Result block         | Interesting set                                                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SUPERVISOR_RESULT`  | `{"failed", "completed_with_escalation"}` (also `"checkpoint"` is interesting)  |
| `CODE_REVIEW_RESULT` | `{"FAIL", "NEEDS_HUMAN"}`                                                       |
| `QA_RESULT`          | any failing test, or any failing self-check gate                                 |

The interest filter runs **after** privacy and target-repo resolution,
**before** dedup. Order matters: privacy violations always log even on
"healthy" runs (audit trail integrity); dedup runs last so dedup never
suppresses a privacy event.

## Dedup window

Same {`task_id`, `score_bucket`, `primary_error`} within the last 6 hours
-> skip (exit 5).

Implementation:

- Hash key: `sha256(task_id + "::" + score_bucket + "::" + primary_error)`
  (using `hashlib.sha256(...).hexdigest()` in stage 1 — `sha256` is in the
  Python stdlib and always available, so there is no `md5` fallback).
- Storage: `.supervisor/logs/telemetry-sent.log` — one line per
  successful send, six tab-separated columns:
  `<iso_ts>\t<hash>\t<task_id>\t<score>\t<bucket>\t<issue_url>`.
- Lookup: scan the last 6h of entries (`awk` on timestamp prefix is
  sufficient at expected volumes). Match column 1 (timestamp) against the
  6h window and column 2 (hash) against the current run's hash; columns
  3-6 are recorded for `/telemetry status` reporting and post-mortem
  triage but are NOT consulted during dedup. If the hash is present, exit 5.

`primary_error`:

- `SUPERVISOR_RESULT`: first item in `subtasks_failed`, else
  `heal_decision` if not `PASS`, else empty.
- `CODE_REVIEW_RESULT`: first `new` BLOCKING issue's `description`, else
  first `new` HIGH issue's `description`, else empty. (The schema has no
  `title` field — see allowed issue keys in the SubagentStop validator at
  `hooks/hooks.json` and the v3 schema in `docs/RESULT_SCHEMAS.md`.)
- `QA_RESULT`: first failing test name, else empty.

---

## Log files

All telemetry logs live under `.supervisor/logs/`. The directory is
already gitignored via the existing `.supervisor/` rule (see CLAUDE.md
quick reference).

| Path                                                      | Format                                                                | Purpose                                |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `.supervisor/logs/telemetry.log`                          | one JSON-ish line per event (`{"event":"...","ts":"...", ...}`)        | Full audit (sends, skips, errors, privacy blocks) |
| `.supervisor/logs/telemetry-sent.log`                     | six tab-separated columns: `<iso_ts>\t<hash>\t<task_id>\t<score>\t<bucket>\t<issue_url>` (hash is sha256; cols 3-6 are for `/telemetry status` + post-mortem triage, not consulted by dedup) | Dedup lookup (cols 1+2); `/telemetry status` last-sent timestamp |
| `.supervisor/logs/telemetry-pending-shown-${session_id}.flag` | empty file (mtime is the signal)                                  | Per-session "consent pending" rate-limit marker |
| `.supervisor/logs/telemetry-pending-shown-nosession-$(date +%Y%m%d%H).flag` | empty file (mtime is the signal)                     | Fallback marker when `session_id` is missing |

Log files are append-only from the script's perspective. Operators can
truncate or rotate them externally; the scripts must tolerate missing
files by creating them on first write.

## Webhook Notifications

**v12.2.0+ — complement to GitHub Issues telemetry, different purpose.**

The webhook system is a separate, opt-in delivery channel for **real-time
operational alerts** (e.g., a Slack incoming-webhook, an internal monitoring
endpoint, a Discord webhook, a PagerDuty Events API URL). It is intentionally
distinct from the GitHub Issues telemetry described above:

| Channel | Purpose | Trigger | Cadence |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| GitHub Issues telemetry | **Longitudinal analytics** — agent scores, issue patterns, trend lines aggregated over weeks | `code-reviewer`, `qa-executor`, `supervisor-runner` SubagentStop | Per qualifying run, dedup-windowed |
| Webhook notifications  | **Real-time ops alerts** — "did the run finish? what's the PR? did self-heal escalate?" | `supervisor-runner` SubagentStop only | Per Supervisor run, fire-and-forget |

Both can be enabled simultaneously, neither depends on the other, and both
fail closed (silent no-op) when their respective configuration is absent.

### Setup

```bash
export AI_AGENT_MANAGER_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.example.com/services/T000/B000/XXXX
```

That's it — once the env var is set in the shell that launches Claude Code,
every Supervisor SubagentStop fires a single POST. No `/telemetry`-style
consent file, no interactive enable command, no per-session state. To
disable, `unset AI_AGENT_MANAGER_WEBHOOK_URL`.

### Payload schema

A single JSON object, `Content-Type: application/json`:

```json
{
  "agent": "supervisor",
  "status": "completed",
  "pr_url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123",
  "summary": "Implemented v12.2.0 webhook notification...",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-10T22:53:00Z"
}
```

Field semantics:

- **`agent`** — always the literal string `"supervisor"` for v12.2.0; reserved
  for future expansion (e.g., `"qa-executor"`) without breaking consumers.
- **`status`** — copied verbatim from `SUPERVISOR_RESULT.status`. One of
  `completed | completed_with_escalation | failed | checkpoint`. Empty
  string if extraction failed (jq missing or malformed payload — see below).
- **`pr_url`** — copied verbatim from `SUPERVISOR_RESULT.pr_url`. Empty
  string when `status ∈ {failed, checkpoint}` (no PR was created).
- **`summary`** — copied verbatim from `SUPERVISOR_RESULT.summary`, **truncated to 2,048 bytes** (with a trailing `...` ellipsis) to stay well under the body-size limits common to chat webhooks (Slack incoming-webhooks reject bodies > 40 KB; many enterprise endpoints are stricter). Receivers needing the full text should reach the PR link.
- **`timestamp`** — UTC ISO-8601 (`%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`) at the moment the
  hook fired (NOT when the Supervisor started).

**Forward-compatibility note:** new fields may be added to the payload in
future versions; consumers MUST ignore unknown fields rather than reject.

### Why a `type: command` wrapper, not `type: http`

Claude Code's hook system supports a native `type: http` hook, but its
env-var interpolation only substitutes `${VAR}` inside the `headers` block
— **not inside the `url`**. Since the entire feature is gated on
`AI_AGENT_MANAGER_WEBHOOK_URL`, the URL has to resolve at hook-fire time
inside a script with shell-level env access, not inside the hook config.
A `type: command` wrapper invoking `send-webhook.sh` is the only way to
read the env var and conditionally fire (or silently skip) the request.

### Tool requirements & graceful degradation

The wrapper requires `curl` to fire the webhook and prefers `jq` for safe
JSON extraction and payload composition. Behaviour when tools are missing:

| Missing / Condition | Behaviour |
|---------------------|-----------|
| `AI_AGENT_MANAGER_WEBHOOK_URL` unset | exit 0 immediately, zero side effects |
| `curl` not on PATH | log one line to stderr, exit 0 (no webhook fired) |
| `jq` not on PATH | field extraction skipped, `status` stays empty → payload-validity guard exits 0, webhook is NOT fired |
| `result_block` absent or `status` empty after extraction | logs `"no status in result block — skipping POST"` to stderr, exit 0 (no webhook fired) |
| Webhook returns non-2xx, times out (>5s), or DNS fails | curl error suppressed, exit 0 |

The wrapper **always exits 0**. The fire-and-forget contract means a slow
or unreachable webhook endpoint will never block a Supervisor run beyond
the 5-second curl timeout.

### URL safety — user responsibility

Unlike GitHub Issues telemetry, which goes only to a target repo configured
through an interactive `/telemetry enable` flow, the webhook URL is taken
verbatim from the env var and POSTed to with no domain whitelist or
validation. Setting `AI_AGENT_MANAGER_WEBHOOK_URL` is an explicit operator
action; the operator is responsible for:

- ensuring the URL points to an endpoint they control or trust;
- ensuring the endpoint accepts unauthenticated POSTs OR carries auth
  inside the URL (e.g., a Slack webhook with a per-channel token in the
  path) — the wrapper does not support arbitrary auth headers in this
  release;
- treating the URL itself as a secret if the endpoint trusts knowledge of
  the URL (Slack, Discord, etc.) — do not commit it.

### Privacy posture

The payload contains only:

- a fixed agent label,
- a Supervisor status enum,
- the GitHub PR URL (already public on the user's repo),
- the SUPERVISOR_RESULT summary string (one or two sentences the
  Supervisor itself authored),
- a timestamp.

No file paths, no diffs, no tool transcripts, no consent file contents,
no env-var dumps. Because the operator chose the destination URL, the
deny-list redaction used by GitHub Issues telemetry does NOT run here —
the trust model is "operator picked the URL and accepts what reaches it."

### Disabling

```bash
unset AI_AGENT_MANAGER_WEBHOOK_URL
```

The next Supervisor SubagentStop will see the wrapper exit 0 immediately
with no log line, no network call, and no side effects.

### Gate events (v14+)

**New in v14.0.0** — `send-webhook.sh` accepts a second event type used by the
`/autonomous` orchestration shell to surface user-gate moments in real time.
The supervisor_result path described above is **unchanged**; gate events run
alongside it on the same script with a separate payload shape.

**Invocation contract** (CLI-flag driven; stdin is NOT read for gate events):

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/send-webhook.sh" \
  --event-type gate \
  --gate-type <phase6_save|rubric|no_rubric|adjudication> \
  --iteration <N> \
  --session-id <session_id> \
  --context "<freeform string>"
```

All flags except `--gate-type` are optional from the script's contract, though
the autonomous-loop call sites always populate `--iteration` and `--session-id`
for correlation. `AI_AGENT_MANAGER_WEBHOOK_URL` gates the POST exactly as it
does for the supervisor_result path — the script exits 0 immediately when
the env var is unset.

**Known `gate_type` values and firing sites** (closed set in v14.0.0; new
values require updating both this doc and `skills/autonomous-loop/SKILL.md`):

| `gate_type`      | Firing site                                                                                 | When                                                                                                |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `phase6_save`    | Launch Pad — Phase 6 brief-save prompt                                                      | Loop is about to ask the user to confirm saving the assembled brief to `.supervisor/jobs/pending/`. |
| `rubric`         | `autonomous-loop` — Signal 1 rubric gate (see `skills/autonomous-loop/SKILL.md` §"Signal 1") | Iteration ended `completed` with `rubric_score N<M` and the gate is asking the user to continue / stop / force. |
| `no_rubric`      | `autonomous-loop` — no-rubric gate (see `skills/autonomous-loop/SKILL.md` §"No-rubric gate") | Iteration ended `completed` but the brief had no `## Outcomes Rubric`; gate is asking continue / stop. |
| `adjudication`   | Supervisor — Phase 3 adjudication AskUserQuestion                                           | Supervisor's existing 4-option adjudication prompt is firing; loop emits the gate event as advance notice. |

**Injection-safety guarantee.** Both the call sites in `skills/autonomous-loop/SKILL.md`
(which forward the user-supplied context string verbatim) and `send-webhook.sh`
itself construct the JSON payload via `jq --arg` on every field — no
shell-templated JSON. The `--context` parameter is therefore safe against
single quotes, double quotes, backslashes, embedded newlines, ASCII control
characters, and Unicode; the receiver sees the exact round-tripped string
with no parse error. **Never** construct the gate payload inline at the call
site; always go through `send-webhook.sh --event-type gate`.

**Dry-run debug switch.** Setting `AI_AGENT_MANAGER_WEBHOOK_DRY_RUN=1` (any
non-empty value) makes the script print the constructed JSON payload to
stdout INSTEAD of POSTing. The env-var gate on `AI_AGENT_MANAGER_WEBHOOK_URL`
still applies — set it to any non-empty value (e.g., `test`) to satisfy the
gate. Useful for the injection-safety self-tests:

```bash
AI_AGENT_MANAGER_WEBHOOK_URL=test \
  AI_AGENT_MANAGER_WEBHOOK_DRY_RUN=1 \
  bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/send-webhook.sh" \
  --event-type gate \
  --gate-type rubric \
  --iteration 2 \
  --session-id auto-2026-05-16-143022 \
  --context "fix user's \"auth\" bug" \
  | jq -e .
```

**Example payload:**

```json
{
  "event_type": "gate",
  "gate_type": "rubric",
  "iteration": "2",
  "session_id": "auto-2026-05-16-143022",
  "context": "iter 2 completed PR https://github.com/org/repo/pull/57 with rubric 3/5; awaiting user decision",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-16T14:55:00Z"
}
```

Field semantics:

- **`event_type`** — always the literal string `"gate"`. Distinguishes gate
  payloads from supervisor_result payloads (which have `"agent": "supervisor"`
  as their stable type discriminator).
- **`gate_type`** — one of the four values in the table above. Consumers
  SHOULD treat unrecognized values as opaque rather than rejecting; new
  values may be added in future versions.
- **`iteration`** — **emitted as a JSON string** (e.g., `"2"`, `"0"`), not
  a number. The value is a 1-indexed iteration counter (`"0"` for
  pre-EXECUTE gates like `phase6_save` before any iteration ran). The
  string shape is a deliberate choice in `send-webhook.sh` (uses
  `jq --arg` rather than `--argjson`) so a non-numeric `--iteration`
  argument from a future caller cannot crash the payload construction.
  Consumers MUST `parseInt(payload.iteration, 10)` (or the local
  equivalent) before doing arithmetic on it — no strict-equality
  comparison against numeric literals like `payload.iteration === 2`.
- **`session_id`** — autonomous-loop session identifier (`auto-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{HHMMSS}`).
- **`context`** — freeform string the call site uses to describe the gate
  state; safe to include PR URLs, rubric scores, and short prose.
- **`timestamp`** — UTC ISO-8601 at the moment the hook fired.

**Privacy posture.** Same as supervisor_result events: the operator chose
the destination URL and accepts what reaches it. The deny-list redaction
used by GitHub Issues telemetry does NOT run here. Gate `context` strings
are author-controlled (autonomous-loop sets them) and typically contain a
PR URL plus a one-line summary — but operators who route the webhook to a
public channel should treat `context` as if it could contain anything the
loop saw fit to forward.

**Cross-references:**

- `skills/autonomous-loop/SKILL.md` §"Signal 1" and §"No-rubric gate" — the
  call sites where `--event-type gate` is invoked.
- `scripts/send-webhook.sh` — the implementation (both event-type paths
  live in the same script).

## Future work (out of scope for this PR)

- **Session-level batch mode.** One issue summarising N tasks per
  session instead of N issues. Spec'd in `temp/self-learning.md` §6B.
- **Weekly summary bot.** Cron-driven aggregation across created issues
  (top failures, trend per agent type).
- **Backend service.** Replacing GitHub Issues with a structured store
  once volume justifies it.
- **AI-generated suggestions.** Currently the `## AI Suggestions`
  section is static placeholder text; a future iteration could derive
  suggestions from the score breakdown and the failing signals.
- **Auto-PR for prompt fixes.** When `agent:{name}-weak` recurs N times,
  draft a PR adjusting the relevant agent's prompt.

These are intentionally deferred so the v1 surface stays small enough
to review and reason about.

## Post-Implementation Notes (Subtask #5 — v11.2.0)

The sections below are authoritative references added after the wrapper,
core, hook, and `/telemetry` slash command landed. They reflect what was
actually shipped, not just what was originally designed.

### Wrapper-vs-Core Architecture (Data Flow)

The runtime data flow from a `SubagentStop` hook firing through to a
posted (or rejected) GitHub issue:

```
SubagentStop hook (Claude Code)
      |
      v stdin (JSON payload)
send-telemetry.sh (wrapper, ALWAYS exit 0)
      |
      +-- captures session_id, runs reaper
      |
      v stdin
send-telemetry-core.sh (core, exit 0..5)
      |
      +-- parse → score → privacy (raw + body) → consent → repo
      |          → interest → dedup → gh
      |
      v exit code + raw stderr
send-telemetry.sh (wrapper, post-core)
      |
      +-- redacts core stderr via the privacy whitelist (defence in depth)
      |   then appends one structured line to telemetry.log
      |
      v exit 0 (always)
.supervisor/logs/telemetry.log
```

Key invariants reflected in the diagram:

- **Wrapper is fire-and-forget.** Claude Code's `SubagentStop` hook can
  never receive a non-zero exit from this pipeline — the wrapper absorbs
  every failure mode of the core (privacy block, no consent, no repo,
  filter skip, generic error) and translates it into a structured log
  line plus `exit 0`.
- **Privacy runs first.** Raw-payload privacy scan happens BEFORE
  consent and target-repo resolution (heal iter 1 of v11.2.0 reorder)
  so a healthy/successful run that contains a leaked secret still emits
  a `PRIVACY_BLOCKED` audit-log entry and exits 2 — never short-circuits
  silently via the interest filter.
- **Core owns all decisions.** Parsing, scoring, consent reading,
  target-repo resolution, the privacy whitelist, the interest filter,
  dedup, and the actual `gh issue create` invocation all live in
  `send-telemetry-core.sh`. The wrapper does no payload inspection.
- **Wrapper owns stderr redaction.** The core's stderr is captured by
  the wrapper to a tmp file, then redacted via the same regex set
  (defined in both `send-telemetry-core.sh` stage-1 Python and
  `send-telemetry.sh` Python — kept in sync per the deny-list table
  above) before being written to `telemetry.log`. This is defence in
  depth: even if a regex bug let a secret leak from core into stderr,
  the wrapper's second-pass redaction blocks it from reaching the log.
- **session_id flows from stdin.** Claude Code injects `session_id` into
  every hook payload; the wrapper extracts it for per-session
  rate-limiting flags (`telemetry-pending-shown-${session_id}.flag` and
  `telemetry-repo-unset-shown-${session_id}.flag`). The reaper deletes
  any of these flags older than ~24 hours opportunistically on each run
  so the log directory does not accumulate stale markers.

### Core Exit Codes (Authoritative)

The canonical exit-code table is defined inline in this document under
[Core exit codes (authoritative)](#core-exit-codes-authoritative). The
mirror below adds the **wrapper-action** column so log-parsers can
correlate a core exit code with what the wrapper does in response. See
the linked section above for the source-of-truth definitions.

| Code | Name                | Meaning                                                                                          | Wrapper action                                                                                                                            |
|------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0    | sent                | Issue posted to GitHub via `gh issue create`. URL appended to `.supervisor/logs/telemetry-sent.log`. | Log primary line `CORE_EXIT=0`. Exit 0.                                                                                                   |
| 1    | generic_error       | Unexpected error (malformed args, JSON parse failure inside repo handling, `gh` CLI failure).     | Log primary line with redacted stderr. Exit 0.                                                                                            |
| 2    | privacy_blocked     | Privacy whitelist matched; issue NOT posted; structured `PRIVACY_BLOCKED pattern=<label>` on stderr (NEVER the matched content). | Log primary line. Exit 0.                                                                                                                 |
| 3    | no_consent          | `.supervisor/telemetry-consent.json` missing or `{"telemetry":"prompt"}`/absent.                  | Log primary line; if per-session pending flag is new, set `PENDING_FLAG_NEW=true` and touch the flag (rate-limits the user-facing notice). Exit 0. |
| 4    | no_repo_configured  | Neither `AI_AGENT_MANAGER_TELEMETRY_REPO` env var nor consent-file `telemetry_repo` is set.       | Log primary line; if the per-session repo-unset flag is new, append a SECOND `telemetry_repo_unset` line with the user-facing remediation hint. Exit 0. |
| 5    | filter_skipped      | Healthy run (score >= 5 AND status in success set), or unknown payload schema.                    | Log primary line `CORE_EXIT=5`. Exit 0.                                                                                                   |

The wrapper's primary log line shape is:

```
[<utc-ts>] CORE_EXIT=<rc> SESSION=<sid|nosession> PENDING_FLAG_NEW=<true|false> STDERR=<one-line-redacted>
```

with sentinel forms for absorbed wrapper-internal failure modes (empty
stdin, missing core executable, redaction unavailable). See the Subtask
#2a worker summary and the wrapper source for the complete log-line
grammar.

### No Default Repo — Explicit Configuration Required

The plugin is intended to be installed in **arbitrary user projects**.
The `origin` remote of the host project is, in nearly every case, the
user's own application repository — not a place where ai-agent-manager
telemetry should land. Defaulting telemetry's target repo to `origin`
would silently leak agent-run metadata, derived scores, and redacted
payloads into the user's app issue tracker, polluting their backlog and
violating the spirit of opt-in consent.

The design therefore disables telemetry **by default** until the user
explicitly configures a target repo via one of two paths: setting the
`AI_AGENT_MANAGER_TELEMETRY_REPO` environment variable, or running
`/telemetry enable` (which prompts interactively for the target repo
and writes it to `.supervisor/telemetry-consent.json`). When neither is
set, the core exits with code `4` (`no_repo_configured`) and the
wrapper logs a single per-session reminder. This decision is also
recorded in the brief at §3 line 70.

### Plugin-Internal `scripts/` vs Repo-Root `scripts/`

The plugin uses two distinct `scripts/` directories with non-overlapping
roles:

- **`ai-agent-manager-plugin/scripts/`** — runtime scripts shipped with
  the plugin and invoked at runtime by hooks or slash commands. The
  telemetry wrapper (`send-telemetry.sh`), core (`send-telemetry-core.sh`),
  fixtures (`telemetry-fixtures/`), and test harness (`test-telemetry.sh`)
  all live here. New runtime scripts MUST go here so they ship with the
  plugin install.
- **Repo-root `scripts/`** — release/CI tooling that exists only in the
  repository checkout, never inside the installed plugin. Examples:
  `validate-version.sh` (version parity between `marketplace.json` and
  `plugin.json`) and `check-command-sync.sh` (drift guard between
  command files and agent prompts). New CI/release helpers go here. New
  runtime scripts MUST NOT go here.
