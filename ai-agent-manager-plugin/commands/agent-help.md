# Agent Help Reference

## Quick Start

The AI Agent Manager plugin provides **5 agents** for your development workflow:

**Requirements Pipeline (1 agent):**
```
0. Discover (Product Owner)  →  User stories with acceptance criteria
```

**Constructive Pipeline (3 agents):**
```
1. Plan (Orchestrator)  →  2. Review (Code Reviewer)  →  3. Commit (Repo Steward)
```

**Independent Auditor (1 agent):**
```
4. Attack (Red Team Reviewer)  →  Finds real-world failures before production
```

**Full Workflow:**
```
/product-owner → User Stories → /orchestrator → Tasks → Code → /code-reviewer → /repo-steward
```

**Task Management:** Beads issue tracker (replaces TODO.md/memory files)

---

## Command Reference

### 0️⃣ /product-owner — Define Requirements

**Purpose:** Translate business problems into user stories with acceptance criteria

**Usage:**
```
/product-owner feature: "staff scheduling for venue events"
/product-owner problem: "we keep double-booking shifts"
/product-owner feature: "order history" --mvp-only
```

**What it does:**
- Reads domain context from CLAUDE.md
- Runs product discovery to understand the problem
- Writes user stories (As a... I want... So that...)
- Defines acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
- Prioritizes scope (MVP / Phase 2 / Nice-to-have)
- Creates Beads stories (type: story)
- Provides handoff to `/orchestrator`

**Example Output:**
```
## BD-15: Staff Shift Assignment (type: story)

**As a** Staff Supervisor at a sports venue,
**I want** to assign staff members to shifts,
**so that** I have adequate coverage.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given an event, when I open assignment, then I see available staff
- [ ] Given a conflict, when I double-book, then I see a warning

### Priority: MVP
### Handoff: /orchestrator goal: "BD-15"
```

**When to Use:**
- Starting a new feature
- When requirements are vague
- Before running /orchestrator
- When you need user stories

### 1️⃣ /orchestrator — Plan Your Work

**Purpose:** Break a goal into minimal, actionable tasks

**Usage:**
```
/orchestrator goal: "add dark mode to UI"
/orchestrator goal: "fix login bug" --project /path/to/project
```

**What it does:**
- Understands your goal
- Reads project context (CLAUDE.md, Beads issue tracker state)
- Creates 3-7 Beads tasks with review gates
- Each implementation task gets a review subtask
- Identifies dependencies (review blocks next task)
- Provides clear acceptance criteria and skill references

**Example Output:**
- BD-20: Dark Mode Toggle (EPIC)
- BD-21: Implement dark mode toggle (TASK)
- BD-22: Code Review - Dark mode (SUBTASK) ← blocks BD-23
- BD-23: Add tests (TASK)
- BD-24: Commit & Link (TASK)

**When to Use:**
- Start of new work
- When goal is unclear or large
- When you need task breakdown
- When planning feature work

**Learn More:** `/orchestrator --help`

### 2️⃣ /code-reviewer — Review Code Changes

**Purpose:** Review code against patterns, flag issues, detect new patterns

**Usage:**
```
/code-reviewer                              # Review git changes
/code-reviewer src/components/Dark.tsx      # Review specific file
/code-reviewer src/components/              # Review folder
/code-reviewer --project /path/to/project   # Auto-detect files
```

**What it does:**
- Reads project patterns (CLAUDE.md)
- Reviews your code for:
  - Type safety issues
  - Security problems
  - Performance issues
  - Pattern violations
  - Test coverage
- Flags issues with severity (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Detects new patterns worth documenting
- Provides specific fixes

**Example Feedback:**
- ✅ Good: 87% test coverage (above 80% threshold)
- ⚠️ HIGH: Missing type annotation on theme parameter
- 📋 PATTERN: New dark mode pattern detected, ready for CLAUDE.md

**When to Use:**
- After writing code
- Before committing
- To learn project patterns
- To catch bugs early

**Learn More:** `/code-reviewer --help`

### 3️⃣ /repo-steward — Create Commits

**Purpose:** Stage changes and create conventional commit messages

**Usage:**
```
/repo-steward                    # Stage and commit (no push)
/repo-steward --project /path    # Explicit project path
/repo-steward --push             # Stage, commit, and push to remote
```

**What it does:**
- Groups changes into logical commits
- Writes conventional commit messages (feat, fix, test, etc)
- Links commits to Beads tasks
- Verifies repo cleanliness (no debug code, secrets, etc)
- Optionally pushes to remote

**Example Commits:**
```
feat(theme): add dark mode toggle to Settings
test(theme): add dark mode tests (89% coverage)
security(hooks): validate localStorage input
```

**When to Use:**
- When you're done coding (after code review)
- At the end of each task
- When you want to organize commits
- Before pushing to remote

**Learn More:** `/repo-steward --help`

### 4️⃣ /summarizer — Summarize Work (Deprecated)

> **Note:** The Summarizer agent has been deprecated in favor of Beads issue tracker. Use `bd close` to close completed tasks and `bd comment` to add notes.

**Previous Purpose:** Update memory files, create session logs

**Current Workflow:**
- Close completed tasks: `bd close BD-XX`
- Add comments: `bd comment BD-XX "Work summary"`
- Pattern proposals: Add to Beads task comments for CLAUDE.md review

---

### 5️⃣ /red-team-reviewer — Attack Your Work (Adversarial)

**Purpose:** Break, stress-test, and ruthlessly critique work under real-world conditions

**Usage:**
```
/red-team-reviewer                              # Attack entire project
/red-team-reviewer src/auth/                    # Attack specific directory
/red-team-reviewer --focus security             # Focus on security
/red-team-reviewer src/api/ --focus cost,scale  # Focus on cost and scale
```

**What it does:**
- Identifies attack surface (entry points, trust boundaries, assumptions)
- Reality-checks claims using Context7 MCP against current docs
- Explores 6 attack vectors:
  - Core flaws & blind spots
  - Real-world operational failures
  - Security, abuse & misuse
  - Scalability & reliability
  - Human & organizational failures
  - Integration & ecosystem
- Reports findings by severity (FATAL, CRITICAL, WARNING, WEAKNESS)
- Provides: Top 3 fatal issues + what convinces hostile expert + prioritized fixes
- Asks if you want findings saved to file

**Example Output:**
- FATAL: JWT algorithm confusion — attacker bypasses auth with alg:none
- CRITICAL: No rate limiting — one user can DoS the system
- Top 3 Fatal Issues + What Would Convince Hostile Expert
- Prioritized Fixes by real-world impact

**Severity Levels:**
| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **FATAL** | Production will fail. Showstopper. |
| **CRITICAL** | Serious pain coming. Not death, but bad. |
| **WARNING** | Future pain. Tech debt with teeth. |
| **WEAKNESS** | Exploitable attack surface exists. |

**When to Use:**
- Before production launches
- After major features
- Security reviews
- Architecture decisions
- When you need brutal honesty (not encouragement)

**When NOT to Use:**
- Regular code changes → Use `/code-reviewer` instead
- Quick pattern checks → Use `/code-reviewer` instead
- Learning codebase conventions → Use `/code-reviewer` instead
- When you want constructive feedback → Use `/code-reviewer` instead

**Key Difference from Code Reviewer:**
| Code Reviewer | Red Team Reviewer |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Constructive | Adversarial |
| Follow patterns | Attack assumptions |
| Helpful tone | Blunt, unsentimental |
| Part of workflow | Independent audit |

## Daily Workflow Example

### Morning: Plan Your Work
```bash
cd /path/to/my-app
/orchestrator goal: "Add dark mode UI to settings page"
```
→ Agent creates Beads tasks with review gates

### Start Work: Claim Task
```bash
bd claim BD-21  # Claim the implementation task
```
→ Start working on the task

### During Work: Code & Review
```bash
# 1. Implement feature...

# 2. Review your code
/code-reviewer src/components/Settings.tsx
```
→ Agent flags issues and outputs PASS/FAIL/NEEDS_HUMAN

### Before Committing: Create Conventional Commits
```bash
git add src/components/Settings.tsx src/hooks/useDarkMode.ts
# Use commit skill for proper formatting
```
→ Commits linked to Beads tasks

### Complete Task: Close in Beads
```bash
bd close BD-21
```
→ Task marked complete, next task unblocked

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fix a Bug
```
/orchestrator goal: "Fix login button not working on mobile"
→ Creates Beads tasks: BD-30 (fix), BD-31 (review), BD-32 (commit)
→ bd claim BD-30, implement fix
→ /code-reviewer to verify → PASS on BD-31
→ Commit and bd close BD-32
```

### Scenario 2: Add a Feature
```
/orchestrator goal: "Add dark mode to application"
→ Creates EPIC with tasks and review gates
→ BD-40: Implement → BD-41: Review (blocks) → BD-42: Tests → BD-43: Commit
→ Work through chain, reviews unlock next tasks
→ bd close each task when done
```

### Scenario 3: Refactor Code
```
/orchestrator goal: "Refactor Settings component to use hooks"
→ Creates Beads tasks with review gates
→ /code-reviewer checks pattern consistency
→ Commit with Beads linking
```

### Scenario 4: Review Someone Else's Code
```
cd /path/to/pull-request-repo
/code-reviewer src/  # Review the changes
```
→ Agent flags issues and outputs PASS/FAIL/NEEDS_HUMAN

### Scenario 5: Pre-Launch Security Review
```
/red-team-reviewer --focus security
→ Red Team attacks auth, inputs, data exposure
→ Reports FATAL issues that must be fixed
→ Provides "what would convince hostile expert"
→ Prioritized fixes before launch
```

### Scenario 6: Stress-Test Before Scale
```
/red-team-reviewer src/api/ --focus scale,cost
→ Red Team attacks scalability, cost assumptions
→ Finds N+1 queries, unbounded operations
→ Reports what breaks at 10x/100x load
→ Prioritized fixes by real-world impact
```

## Key Concepts

### Project Context
Each agent automatically finds your project by looking for `CLAUDE.md`:
- Starts in current directory
- Searches parent directories
- Uses `/path/to/project` if you provide it

### Beads Issue Tracker
Task management is handled by Beads (replaces TODO.md/memory files):
- **`bd list`** — View open/in-progress/completed tasks
- **`bd claim BD-XX`** — Start working on a task
- **`bd close BD-XX`** — Mark task complete
- **`bd comment BD-XX "note"`** — Add notes to task
- **CLAUDE.md** — Codebase knowledge, patterns (still user-maintained)

### Approval Workflow
- ✅ Code Reviews: Agent outputs PASS/FAIL/NEEDS_HUMAN
- ✅ CLAUDE.md Updates: Agent proposes, you approve
- ✅ Commits: Conventional format with Beads linking
- ✅ Pushes: Only with explicit request

---

## Tips & Tricks

### Tip 1: Use Agents Flexibly
You don't have to follow strict order. For example:
- Run `/code-reviewer` first to understand patterns before coding
- Run `/code-reviewer` multiple times during development
- Use `/red-team-reviewer` for adversarial audits before launch

### Tip 2: Combine with Git
```bash
# Review changes before code-reviewer
git diff src/

# See commits after repo-steward
git log --oneline -5

# Push after repo-steward
git push
```

### Tip 3: Multi-Project Workflows
```bash
# Work on project A
cd /path/to/project-a
/orchestrator goal: "Fix bug in A"

# Switch to project B
cd /path/to/project-b
/orchestrator goal: "Add feature to B"  # Auto-detects B's context
```

### Tip 4: Review Before Committing
```bash
# Code first
/code-reviewer src/

# Fix issues
/code-reviewer src/  # Re-review

# When satisfied, commit with Beads linking
git commit -m "feat(theme): add dark mode

Closes BD-21"
```

### Tip 5: Daily Routine
```bash
# Morning: Plan
/orchestrator goal: "Today's goal"

# Claim task
bd claim BD-XX

# During: Code and review
/code-reviewer (as needed)

# Complete: Close task
bd close BD-XX
```
